I am 36, and my sister is 15.

Like just open the tap and you'll get a pretty good listener, and someone who can be counted on to really try to be helpful and empathetic.\n\nBecause I am so reliably this, and because I do this right off the bat, regardless of how  \\*I'm\\* treated, two things often happen:\n\n1. a certain type of person realizes that this is a service I provide that they don't have to do anything more than activate. Consciously or un-, they realize I do this \\*regardless of what I'm given\\* so they realize they don't have to use energy to be reciprocal with me.\n2. I do this automatically and without ever evaluating if the other person has earned this level of attention and care.\n\nNow, part of why I did this is because who wants relationships to be transactional?? And if I am a generous person, doesn't it require me to live my own values regardless of what I'm given?\n\nWell, I've started to realize that there has to be some middle ground. It doesn't have to be transactional, and I am going to continue to be a generous person who wants to provide a lot of deep attention and care...but  I need to make sure I'm not burning up that energy on people who can't help me renew it by returning some attention and care back to me.\n\nOk that's a lot about me, I'm sorry, but I just see in your description of what you've now realized if this might be a mechanism at work with this person and in your life. And if so, I've realized a by-product of this dynamic is that this kind of person, in addition to not feeling a need to reciprocate, per the above, also never feels the need to, for lack of a better word, do anything to earn my friendship.\n\nSo I could see this kind of person seeing their invitations as currency to spend to increase intimacy or impress someone they want to cultivate a relationship with but since you're already on board with providing hot and cold running care and attention, she doesn't need to \"spend\" an invitation on you.\n\nSomething I've had to do with some of these relationships is just re-frame them. I need to not think of this person as someone who can give me the kind of empathetic warmth and concern I might like, but they might be fun! They might be interesting, or they  might help the work day go by faster. But I no longer expect them to meet certain emotional needs, and I also, frankly, have put a bit of a limit on the hot and cold running care I was providing. Not punitively, but as self-protection. (And usually they don't seem to even notice! So I was wringing myself out for...what, exactly?!)\n\nAnyway, I hope I haven't gone too far afield of your original issue, just some things that the additional details really made me think of in my own life.", "I had a similar situation (sort of). I was best friends with a guy since we were 13. He had some success in his life and we remained very close. He ended up dating a woman who was/is pretty famous. A short time after he started dating her, I found out from my mother's friend (who didn't know that I didn't know) that they were engaged. She had heard about it on the news or from some website. I looked it up on my phone and found out they had been engaged for two weeks. I still sucked it up and congratulated him. I was very upset, but kept it to myself because I didn't want to ruin the happy time for him. He talked to me about the wedding and how it was going to be very small, in her home state. Only immediate family. I joked I was disappointed that I wouldn't get to see him get married (years earlier he had told me I would be a \"groomsman\" when/if he ever did), but that I understood why they would want to keep it small. Months later, they get married. I see pictures on different websites and his sister and mothers FB pages. There were well over 100 people present at that wedding. Standing up next to him was his college roommate (obviously not an immediate family member) and my heart broke. Then, it hit me: our friendship had been one-sided for years and I didn't even notice or cared to notice. When it was his birthday, I would call and wish him a happy birthday. On my birthday, I wouldn't hear from him or I would hear but he would make no mention that it was my birthday. Not finding out about his engagement and not being invited to his wedding opened my eyes. After that, I stopped making an effort and he seemed to notice and stopped making one in return. About 2.5 years ago, he emailed me saying he didn't know where the friendship went but would I help him with a new TV project he was working on. I used the excuse that I was too pregnant (I was) to give it 100% of my time. He didn't congratulate me or anything. That sealed the deal for me. \n\nMy advice to you is to ask your friend whats up.

Tell him you're going to try it just once, but want him to come along as moral support for *you*. Edit: thank you for the GOLD! And OP, so sorry for your loss.", "This is actually something I can contribute to, and I hope I can be helpful. At 34, I'm older than either your daughter or her BF, but I have some experience in this. Three years ago, my girlfriend died after 15 months fighting leukaemia. I already got on really well with her family, but we became really close during the whole ordeal. My then-girlfriend and I both lived in the UK (having met here), but are/were both Canadian, and her family still lived there. When she was diagnosed, they both spent as much time over here as they could, and at the end basically lived here full-time. My late-GF and I were long-distance, and I would usually come up on alternating weeks, again more often near the end. We all lived at my girlfriend's flat, and that, plus the reality of the situation, brought us all together.\n\nIt was no surprise when she passed, as we'd all known it was coming for a few months. But that didn't lessen the effect. Her parents stuck around for a few weeks after, until the memorial was done, then had to go back to Canada.\n\nSince then, her mother and I have kept in touch, and I periodically speak with her father and routinely post things back and forth on Facebook with her brother. He mother has outright told me, as well a shown me, that she considers me a son-in-law in everything but name. I'm part of their family and they're part of mine.\n\nYour daughter's boyfriend is in a very fucked up place. His world is turned around and being 20 years old will only magnify that and the importance of everything. The reality is that he will eventually meet someone else, and he will love again; he's 20, of course he will. But there is no chance that he can see that. So, if I could give you a recommendation, I would say that you just need to be there for him. Think of him like the son of your best friend. Someone you know, and care for, but don't see every day. Let him know that you're there for a shoulder to cry on or for a drink. Commiserate and share stories of your daughter and the great times they had together and you did with her. You will both have memories and talking about them can help you both remember the happy times.\n\nI wouldn't push for things like therapy, meeting new friends or \"don't worry, you're young, you'll be OK/love again\" etc. If you feel comfortable helping him find somewhere else to live, or putting him up on your couch for a few weeks, that might not be a bad idea, but don't push it too hard. When you're that age, \"I have nothing left\" is an easy place to go to. Just be there and give him a sense of normalcy and regular life when you can, but don't back away from what happened. Let him know that you guys share a tragedy-when my late GF died, I felt guilty for awhile because I felt like I was imposing on her parents' grief and tragedy-they had known her for 32 years, we'd only been dating for 3.5. But they acknowledged and recognised my pain, and they validated that it was serious and real and deserving. We shared the loss together, spoke openly about both the loss and the love we had for her. And that made it a lot easier to get through.\n\nFeel free to PM me at any point if you want, I'm happy to share more or go over specifics. And though I realise first-hand how empty a thing this is to say, I am so sorry for what you've gone through, and for your loss.", "I'm so, so sorry for your loss. This must be a very trying time for you and your wife.\n\nAs I am sure you and your wife have noticed, it is a lot easier to overcome grief when you have someone to share with, but this young man has lost the partner who he would normally have shared his grief with. It is very noble of you to want to try to guide him through his grief. But considering you don't know him well, I doubt there is much you can personally do for him except continue to be pleasant with him when you happen to see him, and try to keep in touch and talk to him if he is willing. If you know how to contact his parents, or if you know any of your daughter's close friends who might also be close with him, the best thing you can do is to inform them of the sentiments he expressed to you and that you are worried about his mental health and ask them to keep an eye on him and check in with him to make sure he is safe.", "First, I'm very sorry for your loss.  It must be devastating to lose a child.  I think your empathy for this kid is amazing, given what you are going through.  But you are picking up on something important - you are equipped with the life experience to know that this phase of deep grief will pass.  There will always be a scar on your heart, but the wound will stop bleeding.  He seems to be drowning in it, with no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nCan you contact his family as well?  Do you know any of the people in their circle of friends?  Reach out and let everyone know of your concerns.\n\nEven if you are overreacting, it is incumbent on you to alert those around him that he might be suicidal.  He should definitely be in therapy, even if it is a local church or YMCA/JCC Bereavement Support Group.  Make some phone calls, offer to go with him - you would benefit from it yourself.  He may be too grief-stricken to take action.\n\n**Take action.  You'd never forgive yourself if you said/did nothing and then something awful happened.  Good luck.**", "My gf died when she was 21 and I was 26. What helped me the most was the family continuing to include me in their life. They made me feel like part of their family. They'd have me over for dinner on random nights, and I'd even spend thanksgiving with them and go to their lake house a couple times. I think it helped them as much as it helped me.\n\nBut I really didn't know how to grieve and would spend all day thinking like \"what do I do now?\"...Not a deep philosophical question but literally what do I do today/tonight? Passing time became incredibly difficult, so every time anyone included me in anything was greatly appreciated. I feared having to go home after work with nothing to do, knowing I'd be alone with my thoughts all night. She committed suicide, so it was impossible not to think about suicide. Not doing it myself, but just that it exists, and it's scary. Unlike other causes of death, you can't sweep that dark thought under the rug. It's right in your face. So just being around people I know was helpful. Being with her family was doubly helpful because I could kinda see how they were grieving and take cues and learn from them.

Her boyfriend was her health care proxy and he told no one she was in the hospital until she died (cirrhosis and pancreatitis).  When we told her daughters, they both said they would have gone to see her in the hospital.  I would at the very least let them know, write them a letter or something. ", "I'm 42.  The last time I saw my dad I was 15.  Over the years he tried to contact me via my mom a couple times.  I never contacted him back.  I felt no need to have him back in my life.\n\n2 years ago, while I was traveling, I got an email from his brother.  My dad had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and given 3 months to live.  I was returning to the US in a month and his brother told me that my dad realized that he'd been a shitty parent had had no right to expect anything from me but that he'd like to see me and apologize before he died.  His brother asked me to consider visiting my dad when I returned to the country.\n\nI'll be honest, it was a shock.  And I struggled a bit with the decision.  For all intents and purposes, my dad had been dead for decades.  So hearing from him out of the blue was a bit of a shock.  I told my uncle that I would think about it and get back to him in a day or two.  I talked to my mom and some friends and ultimately, I decided to see him.  Not really for me, I was kind of ambivalent about it.  But I felt that if it would give him some peace at the end to apologize, I would do that.\n\nI sent an email to my uncle the next day.  He received it about 3 hours after my dad died.\n\nI don't really regret not seeing him.  I wasn't doing it for me.  The only thing I regret is that he died before finding out that I'd agreed to see him so he didn't get that peace.\n\nSo, take that for what you will.  If you have an intermediary that won't harass them, perhaps ask them to make contact on your behalf.  Just tell them that you'll be gone soon and you'd like the chance to apologize.  Let them know that you know you fucked up so you accept and respect their decision if they don't want to see you.  And make sure whoever is contacting them doesn't pressure them at all.

But I would want to know how she plans to change her behavior in the future when you\u2019re feeling unwell. \n\nI think it\u2019s possible that this was a wake up call for her that not everyone she encounters in this world will be like her parents & that she needs to work on those issues. But I also think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019s just trying to assuage her guilt here & will end up trying to shift blame back onto you for not doing enough to convince her this was a serious health problem. ", "When you pick a partner for life, the very least you should expect from that person is a ride to the hospital when you think you might be dying.", "If I asked my SO to stay with me because I had neck pain so bad that I couldn't breathe I would feel SO betrayed if they left. Your reaction is 100% justified. Her first reaction should have been concern for you. In a normal reaction, she should have asked if you wanted her to bring you to the hospital. I get that her past makes it difficult for her to be empathetic in situations like this but she needs individual therapy to figure that out. Imagine if she ever had kids and she didn't believe them when they felt ill... that would be considered neglect. ", "OP, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see this but in my personal experience I\u2019ve had three times in my life I needed someone\u2019s support due to medical reasons. 2 were scheduled, 1 was not.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how much incredible resentment I have for my husband that he wasn\u2019t there for me. I had my wisdom teeth taken out, I had 4 all at once and I was given hydrocodone. He was supposed to tell me to let the doctors office know if I threw up on it. I threw up a lot for about three days because it made me so nauseous. He laughed about it later like \u201coh hee hee I was supposed to tell you that.\u201d \n\nI had hives break out all over my body and my eyes were swollen. I didn\u2019t even call him to let him know because I\u2019d been begging him to address my needs for emotional support at that time and he just dismissed me. He was upset I didn\u2019t call him but quite frankly I didn\u2019t even think he\u2019d cared at all.\n\nI had bunion surgery (it involves cutting into the bone). His mom is a JustNo who had all these people helping her with the loss of a family friend... I partially understand it. But I had no one. I was at home, unable to move because it hurt so much and I was on powerful narcotics. Truthfully if I needed to I probably would have messed the bed because that\u2019s how much pain I was in. \n\nHe left me alone when I shouldn\u2019t have had to ask for him to stay. Thinking about it now, that\u2019s not something you should have to ask of your partner. \n\nOP, would you risk your life on your gf taking you seriously of your medical needs? Sure she needs counseling, but until she learns to stop dismissing your medical needs... she should do that on her own time and you shouldn\u2019t be her guinea pig until she figures that shit out.  \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t owe her a damned apology. She needs to grow the hell up.", "Personally, I would meet up with her and see if she is actually sincere or not. If she is honestly remorseful, maybe this situation has been a wake up call for her and shown her that not everyone is constantly afraid of illness like her parents. Maybe she's seen that sometimes people are actually sick and not overreacting to the extreme every time they complain. If she is sorry and feels bad, I think you should apologize for what you said. You admit you said some very nasty things, and, drugged or not, an apology from you for your words is also warranted.\n\nIf she is more focused on getting an apology and glossing over how she acted.....I would say dump her. Because she'll just keep up the mean behavior.\n\nRegardless, she should probably get some therapy for herself. I can't imagine growing up in a house where you're getting dragged to doctors constantly for very sniffle or perceived illness, and having your parents tell you they're dying all the time. Or being told you yourself are dying. Either situation would be terrifying for a child. I can imagine that would cause some serious psychological damage to a kid.

Go to the meeting. Introduce your lawyer and say you are here to talk about teacher's misconduct. Redirect any conversation away from your sister and back to the teacher.

When you go in there, there will be multiple people from the school, and you. Your situation is sad and seems to be well known. \"Backup\" will give you confidence and reduce the chance of you getting bullied and intimidated down from addressing the teacher's behavior. It will also increase the likelihood of them taking your seriously instead of treating you like a child (they may see you as a child/peer to your sister, not an adult/parent).", "- Always be calm. Show some concern over the teachers methods and other students in school. Be approachable and reasonable to the school, even if teacher repeats what she says. Be the calm adult in the room. Principal might side with you to avoid conflict if you're the best in the room.\n\n- Describe yourself as legal guardian\n\n- Mention other parents have confirmed to you what happened. Schools listen to parents more than students. If the other parents are on your side use it, schools hate parents opinions being against them.\n\n- As your sister shouted you can apologise for that but only if they accept the teacher was unprofessional and action will be taken (if they get dickish about it). Stand your ground over how unprofessional the teacher was when treating a student. Express a teenager will have difficulties being personally attacked first that way esp mentioning your parents in such a way. A teacher in a childs care should know better. You'd expect those comments from a student, not a teacher. She failed in her duties and emotionally harmed a great student.\n\n- If your sister has done anything good for the school or has good grades mention them. Say this is out of character and it must have been provoked (teacher talking about your passed away parents in such a way and homophobic comments). Show concern over your sisters well being.\n\n\n- Check or even ask if they have any policy on LGBT students, bullying or all students being treated equally. Ask if they're willing to express this policy to prevent future incidents. It always good to come with a solution which will make you and your sister happy.\n\n- See what any LGBT support groups or national are like. Any advice, legal or how to deal with schools etc. [Stonewall](http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/initial_teacher_training/default.asp) UK has resources for schools on LGBT issues. If it is UK there are anti discrimination laws, but they might spin it to say your sister was trouble student and its not LGBT issue. \n\n- Like people said maybe go with a lawyer, worst case look up for back up schools or home teaching if it becomes bigger deal. Your sister still needs to get her education. There are risks, maybe for second meeting if it escalates. \n\n- Ask your sister first, if she wants to go back into sports after x amount of time or wants to be removed from class or join another with different teacher. If school doesn't move teacher off coaching or class. Then at least get teacher to sign document saying she'll refrain from comments about your sisters personal life and will treat her fairly like any other student. Keep safe for any other incidents.

And in my experience, among the population of people who say \"yes\" to that question, probably less than a quarter stay together for more than a couple years at most.  At the heart of the reason why is the question of forgiveness.  It's paradoxical and unfair, but when your boyfriend cheated on you (and I understand this was 'emotional' cheating but it's frankly worse than a one-night stand you only just found out about.  He didn't just have *sex* with someone who wasn't you, he *loved* and shared *intimacy* with someone other than you), he placed a huge burden at your feet.  That burden is the heavy lift of forgiving him, and most people can't manage it.  They'll pretend to, and may even stay with their partner for years later, but the trust is broken and things are never really the same.  You were betrayed, and you will never really stop being wary of your betrayed.  For some people its just a feeling of sadness that metastasizes into depression and resentment and then the relationship ends.  Other people become their partners probation officer - checking their communications and interrogating their motives and always knowing where they are and who they are with.  That obviously goes down in flames too, since again, the trust is gone and you can't love someone you don't trust.\n\nGive yourself permission to look at the boulder he just asked you pick up for him and say \"no thanks\".  Relationships cannot be sustained by good memories alone.  Relationships cannot function healthily without trust and intimacy.

Opening about this stuff shows a person really trusts someone and thinks highly of them so while it's a lot for you to handle, it's a weird compliment as well.\n\nThat said don't be afraid to set boundaries around discussing stuff like this. My GF and I both have eating disorders (pre-dating meeting each other) and we both firmly refuse to engage in 'baiting' type talk with each other like when the other says 'do you think i'm gaining weight?' or 'did you read about this diet?'. \n\nWe will ask the other why they are feeling like they are needing that coping strategy right now but refuse to engage in the behaviour. We always try to do it with love as in 'I will not harm you by helping you self harm' rather than  shame like 'oh my god, why would you do that?'\n\nWe also found that often it was easier to open up when you weren't face to face so phone calls, texts, walking side by side or lying in bed in the dark made it easier to say vulnerable things such as disclosing feelings or setting boundaries. \n\nAnd for really really tricky stuff as we got to know each other better and read moods and cues we used certain animal memes and photos as a proxy. It's a bit like when kids ask if teddy can have their tummy rubbed when they feel worried about asking for their needs to be met directly but surprisingly adaptive to adults. My GF and I store up our chosen animal photos and memes and send them if we don't have words for stuff yet so the picture of the snake in a jumper says it for you and then becomes a shorthand so you can ask later 'are you a snake in a sweater kind of day?'\n\nI find everyone with anxiety responds well to boundaries and a lack of uncertainty so instead of her thinking 'oh shit what if he hates me now because it's 7 hours since I talked to him about this' you can text and say 'hey, just grabbing breakfast and doing the laundry so probably going to be off text for a bit but if you'd like to talk about stuff from last night, want to chat after dinner?'\n\nThat kind of response stops her spiralling which then makes he unable to talk it through later and sets your boundary that you need time to process it. It doesn't enable but creates the best possible way to come back to stuff for both of you. I always find it super helpful when people don't leave me hanging or return my vulnerability with sincerity.\n\nHope that helps. Also if it's appropriate offer to help her with the practicalities of finding meds and therapy in your country. It's hard doing that with anxiety anyway but even without anxiety having a native who just knows how the medical system or whatever in new place works really helps. \n\nOften a lot of living in a new country is translating the culture more than the language per se. I live in the UK and have played guide for many American friends who are baffled by the NHS or why British people queue so much even though we all speak the same verbal language.

I started dating someone 2 months ago, and I\u2019ve drunkenly told him things that I regretted the next day. I\u2019ve apologized a dozen times over, but he reassured me that I can\u2019t scare him away with my mental illnesses. Heck, we can relate on some levels, since we share ADHD. I still feel really guilty, but I absolutely feel like I can trust him even more.\n\nWell, I\u2019m in the throes of a depressive episode, and I\u2019m currently in hospital. I fully, entirely, definitely expected my boyfriend to get freaked out and break things off or at least back away. That\u2019s a helluva way to kick off a relationship. But he blew me out of the water by telling me he\u2019s thankful I\u2019m getting help, he still loves me, he wants to sneak his cats into my room, he misses me, AND he visited and gave me a foot massage. I recently got privileges to leave the unit, and he said he\u2019ll take me on a date. When I said, \u201cI can\u2019t leave the hospital...\u201d he replied, \u201cThen it will be a hospital date!\u201d\n\nYou have no idea how much all of this means to me. Just like your girlfriend, I\u2019ve let myself be vulnerable around him, and he responded with kindness that melted my heart. Vulnerability is very scary, and taking the time to say, \u201cI know opening up is hard, I feel honoured that you let me in, and I will always listen\u201d can make a world of difference.\n\nIn my opinion, let her know how you feel so she doesn\u2019t agonize over it and try to push that vulnerability away from you.

", "He didn't just cheat on you with some random chick. He met someone started a relationship with them, for YEARS! And got engaged. You're the side chick. He isn't the love of your life. He's an asshole. Have some self respect and get fucking angry! He lied to you everyday for years. Over and over and over again. He's all you've ever known, so I know it's scary. But you deserve so much better! You're young and can get over all of this. Leave him. ", "he is leading a secret life with a woman he's planning on marrying.  he didn't kiss someone on the cheek.  you do not know this man at all.  your entire relationship is a lie.  he has no respect for you or your relationship.  why in the FUCK would you do ANYTHING other than kick his lying cheating ass out?  you should pack up his shit and leave it outside the door and change the locks.", "I'm soooo sorry. This sounds like a horrible situation. 8 years is a very long time and he's really the only love you know. The fact is, though, he's engaged to someone else. AND he hid it from you. He probably does love you and does care about you, but in his own selfish way. \n\nHe was around your age when he met you- what do you think about dating a 19 year old? Does it sound appealing to you? Do you think you're at the same intellectual level and maturity level? I am only 25, and my sister is around that age and we have a lot in common, but there is a clear difference in our stages of life. I'd bet that he was with this girl and committed to her, met you and you were young, cute, and into him, and it developed into a relationship on the side. For 8 years, if he wanted you to be the only one for him, he could have broken up with her. He could have proposed to you. But he didn't- he wants to marry her, and he wants you to be his secret. It's fucking shitty and he's a piece of shit. People who love you don't do this to you. He loves you selfishly- he loves you for himself. He loves you as a person he can confide in and have sex with- not as a person he wants as his life partner.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe we aren't built for monogamy. A lot of people choose not to be monogamous. But they don't lie to the people they're seeing. They don't keep secrets. He is not just poly or a swinger or any type of non-monogamous person. He is just a straight up two-faced liar. Grieve the person you thought you knew, because he never existed. You're going to feel a lot of pain for a lot of time. But then eventually one day you'll be falling asleep and realize that you didn't cry all day for the first time in a long time. And then it'll be a few days in a row that you didn't cry. And little by little you'll find yourself again.", "What do you do?! Pack your shit and leave when he's \"at work.\" I went through something similar about 6 years ago. You will suffer like hell, you will get over it, and you will move on.\n\nYou can't heal and move on until you make the decision that it IS over, you deserve better, and you make your exit strategy RIGHT NOW.\n\nHe won't come to his senses and realize he's made a mistake. He DOESN'T love you, or even really care about you.  Hard pill to swallow? Yup! Painful lesson? You bet. You're young and you will recover.\n\nAfter I left my boyfriend of more than 5 years, who was unfaithful (and abusive), he married 6 months later. Guess what? He did the same thing to his wife.

I feel so bad for him, yet I don't at the same time. He had so many chances to reach out to us. \n\nMy advice to you is to talk to your brother. Get to him before it's too late. He may be upset that you even bring it up, but it's worth not losing him. He's going to regret missing all of the chances he had to see his family while he could. I'm sure your brother's fiance is extremely manipulative and has some kind of hold on him, and he needs to step back for a moment and think of the consequences this kind of relationship can have.\n\nBest of luck, so sorry this is happening to your family."], "edited": true, "body": ["brother", "fianc", "year", "honest", "start", "great", "begin", "famili", "nice", "tri", "treat", "like", "famili", "weird", "talk", "go", "dinner", "demand", "brother", "separ", "tabl", "away", "rest", "famili", "vacat", "differ", "shit", "year", "talk", "want", "kick", "room", "parent", "away", "purpos", "leav", "mess", "clean", "plan", "birthday", "parti", "birthday", "rummag", "room", "go", "petti", "stuff", "like", "wors", "brother", "friend", "happi", "lucki", "outgo", "person", "stop", "let", "friend", "go", "famili", "togeth", "brother", "sister", "live", "differ", "citi", "year", "move", "citi", "hour", "away", "univers", "month", "okay", "friend", "bizarr", "feel", "like", "enjoy", "univers", "clean", "apart", "time", "latest", "thing", "happen", "sister", "engag", "parti", "brother", "fianc", "come", "demand", "home", "friend", "parti", "parent", "drive", "home", "hour", "drive", "go", "parti", "basic", "let", "want", "ruin", "parti", "sister", "end", "go", "regardless", "punish", "ignor", "phone", "day", "allow", "come", "home", "away", "work", "thing", "tri", "plan", "wed", "express", "open", "want", "marri", "text", "phone", "dyslex", "type", "text", "demand", "parent", "wed", "clarifi", "petti", "thing", "brother", "ador", "brother", "boyfriend", "sister", "fianc", "famili", "famili", "tri", "hard", "brother", "fianc", "feel", "comfort", "know", "reconcil", "soon", "go", "home", "want", "associ", "anymor", "feel", "like", "bring", "stress", "childish", "stop", "talk", "thing", "piss", "engag", "thing", "sister", "go", "person", "deserv", "happi", "hurt", "know", "brother", "fianc", "want", "ruin", "tldr", "brother", "fianc", "control", "includ", "friend", "famili", "see", "brother", "sister", "engag", "parti", "brother", "immatur", "stand", "need", "advic", "deal", "sorri", "super", "long", "post", "feel", "like", "need", "context", "thank", "advanc"], "id": "ceqq7u"}, {"comments": [">But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past.

My ex husband read my journals when we were married, towards the end. He not only read them, he copied them and gave them to his divorce attorney to use against me in court. It was pretty much my only healthy emotional outlet, and he took it away from me. We've been divorced over a decade, and I've never been able to write a single word since then. It was such an enormous violation, my only truly safe space to sort out my thoughts and emotions, and it was the moment I knew for sure our marriage was over. \n\nHere's what I see: He wasn't just skimming them to be sure you were OK, to check up on you, to see what you really thought of him, and so on. He made copies. He made *notes.* Snooping is absolutely not OK, but making copies and notes on it is absolutely beyond normal human weakness. It hints at something much darker, much scarier. It's a bad, bad sign. \n\nThe rest of your post sent chills up my spine. You about to quit your job to raise children that haven't even been conceived yet? I'd bet anything he's been encouraging and pushing and hinting at that. Then he'd have total control over what you do, where you go, and records of your every move. You could never leave him because you'd need him, you couldn't support yourself. He'd be able to, even have to, approve your every purchase, know your every whereabout, monitor your entire life. \"Not having to lift a finger\" also implies total passivity, at least in certain tones. It can imply a life of leisure, or a life of never going against him. Being a homemaker or stay at home parent is fine for those who choose it, but do you even *want* to quit your job to be home for children who are so far hypothetical? Do you feel safe and an equal partner if the only money is \"his\"? Will it also be yours?\n\nYou've given up friends because he says you have \"martial duties\" now. What duties were being neglected by having friends? Does he require all of your attention all of the time? Does he expect you to cater to him? Were you out clubbing with them until 4 am every night? Or were you not home once a month or so to cook him dinner or something?\n\nYou've given up your favorite hobby because he thinks it's \"dangerous\". Were you into extreme hiking in dangerous conditions and dangling off the Grand Canyon with no safety gear or climbing Everest without preparing? Did you go out without a map or communication or a plan or proper provisions? Or was it just normal hiking along a nature trail or something? Was it time to yourself to be you and feel whole and that made him feel threatened?\n\nA marriage should not make you feel like a prop to serve your spouse. A marriage should be a partnership where each party is loved and accepted for who they are and has an equal voice as that person. It's not two halves of a whole, it's two wholes making something better as a team. It's certainly not where one person dictates who the other is, takes away their autonomy, and chips away at everything that makes them themselves. \n\nYou do sound depressed. That doesn't mean you're the problem here. It sounds like he is purposely and systematically wearing down the person you are to make you into the perfect servant for him. It sounds like he's slowly gaining more control over what you do, where you go, how much power you have, whether or not you can leave, and who you are. He's isolating you, he's violating your privacy, he's taking away your autonomy, and he's wearing down at the person you are. And he's making you feel like it's your fault. \n\nDon't let him. Run. Run far, run fast, run now. If you stay with this man, you will wake up one day years from now and realize you are nothing but a servant to his wants, needs, whims, and moods. And you'll have no way out, he'll have you trapped. Do not quit your job, do not have children with this man, do not allow yourself to be trapped right now. Get help, seek a therapist, keep your own money, think for yourself, examine this with open eyes and a clear mind. Be absolutely sure that you will have a voice and be a partner if you follow through with this plan. \n\nMy feeling is that this man is dangerous to you and you will lose yourself completely if this goes on. Please make sure that this is what you want, and if it's not or you're not sure, get out. Now.

Reading all of that, of course you feel down.\n\nYou said he makes a good living, yes? Could y\u2019all afford for a maid to come in, just once a week, to tidy up the house?\n\nBetter yet, maybe hire a professional caretaker to handle the kids for 1-2 days per week. Taking them to appointments, taking care of their needs, etc.\n\nIf you could free up just a bit of time for yourself, where you can handle other household tasks, prep healthy meals that can be stored in the freezer for the rest of the week, or even just go do something you used to love for a while, I think the entire energy of the home could be changed. You just need help.\n\nOne idea could be that you hire a maid, yes, and then also hire a professional caretaker to take care of your kids 3 nights a week for an hour or so. With that time, go work out\u2014it sounds like this weight issue is causing more problems than just physical discomfort for you, it sounds like it\u2019s really hitting your self-esteem hard, as well.\n\nTL;DR: You need to call in reinforcements of SOME kind. I agree that your husband should be coming in earlier and helping around the house more, but sometimes our spouses need to see us make a big, difficult change ourselves, and then they can begin to see the light, and follow along.\n\nNot that you haven\u2019t already been shouldering the burden of so many responsibilities in this relationship already! But sitting down with him and saying, \u201cI\u2019m unhappy, and I\u2019ve identified some of the key reasons why, and here\u2019s my game plan for how to fix it: I\u2019m getting a maid to come clean once a week, and I\u2019m hiring a professional sitter to watch the kids while I go work out three nights a week. I think we\u2019re both unhappy coming home to a filthy house, and I know my self-esteem has tanked since gaining this weight, and I genuinely think that coming home to a bright, clean house and feeling like I still have *some* time to focus on just me, will dramatically improve the energy around here, and even in our relationship.\u201d\n\nGo ahead and find out the pricing of maids and professional sitters in your area, reconcile it with your budget, and lay it out for him so he can see the benefit.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a great chance your husband does in fact love you tremendously still, but he\u2019s feeling so bogged down and sad about where he is in life right now, sex just sounds difficult. Men are emotional creatures, too, and sex is an emotional act. Masturbation is a basic release, but sex requires intimacy and vulnerability. If he\u2019s feeling overweight, in pain, worried that he\u2019s disappointing you, and overwhelmed about his house, his children, and his job, (have you asked him why he stays so late? Maybe he genuinely has a lot on his plate?) sex isn\u2019t going to sound great, despite what we\u2019re told about men basically being animals when it comes to always wanting sex.\n\nStart to contain The Overwhelm, beginning first with things that you can do on your own, (since he\u2019s rejecting the idea of couple\u2019s therapy ATM) and see if the mood and general calm in your house begins to improve.\n\nObviously, again, this isn\u2019t your fault or your sole responsibility, (I hope I don\u2019t sound like I\u2019m saying this is on you?) but since you\u2019re on your own for right now, take charge where you can, and see what things can change, so you can gradually take steps toward a healthier, happier home environment for you and your family.\n\n**Edit:** OP, check below this comment for a LOT of great recommendations for resources! Lots of Redditors suggested some great ways to get help that sound perfect for you!", "I second the childcare option 1/2 days a week. I think if you have some time to yourself to get things going as far as weight loss by prepping healthy food for the week and maybe some alone time with yoga or some other healthy activity-I liked spinning, It will do wonders for your\nPsyche. Also, getting your hair/nails done can do wonders for your self esteem. Work on you.  If by then he doesn\u2019t seem to be responding to your pleas to fix your relationship, you may want to rethink your relationship. By then, with some self confidence, you\u2019ll hopefully have the strength to do what you need to do. Therapy is also a wonderful thing.", "Oh my God this sounds so hard on you. You have so much on your plate. I think that the main problem is that you need to take care of two high maintenance children 24/7. Most people would feel exhausted and depressed and like everything is up in flames all the time. On top of that there's the relationship peoblem with your husband.\n\nThe first thing you should do is find a way to have some free time. Some time to feel like yourself again and you'll feel a lot better. Did a sitter, or a maid. Maybe friends or family. Anyone that can take some of the burden off of you. Work your problems out with a therapist and press on the marriage counseling. \n\nBest of luck", "Among other things, your husband may be unconsciously afraid to have sex and accidentally end up with a third kid. \n\nFor now, change what you have the power to change. See a therapist for your stress, depression and eating disorder. Get some respite care so you\u2019re not a slave to the kids/house 24/7. Find a couples counselor. Go away for a long weekend without the kids. The dead bedroom is a symptom of a bigger set of problems that need to be addressed.", "You mustmustmust call in some reinforcements. Hire a maid or sitter if you can afford it.  Ask a friend or family member to sit with the kids so you can clean, work out, meditate, whatever. Put your shame to the side and confide in a friend; I know what a difficult proposition this is but I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised at the love and support you will receive. Even if someone will just help you take the kids for a walk and let you vent, that would do wonders. Being a caretaker is exhausting and if you don't take care of yourself, you're no good to anyone else.\n\nIt sounds like you're probably already doing this, but depending where you live (I'm assuming U.S.) you should be able to access a variety of support services for your children. In addition to school-based special education programs, there may also be personal care assistance, a community companion, or a safe place where you can drop the kid(s) off after school hours for activities and social time. Just an hour to breathe sounds like it would amazing for you. I work in this field, please feel free to inbox me. \n\nLastly, your husband has GOT to acknowledge the tenuous state of both your emotions and marriage.

He was a...very sexually active person before we met & yet had never really given oral to a girl (it was HS so idk if the girls just weren\u2019t comfortable asking for what they wanted or something but he never offered anyways). He was always told by girls he had sex with that he was like a fucking pornstar or something, & so shortly after we started dating I had to break it to him that I was really unimpressed by how little effort he put into making me cum. He wasn\u2019t all that great. It was one of the factors that made me not want to have sex with him. He didn\u2019t care about making me cum, he wanted me to do all this work to make him feel like a sex god & yet...I had to struggle to get him to touch my fucking vagina. So I told him, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re insecure about possibly not being good at head, I\u2019ll freaking record an audio book for you of what to do step by step if it means you\u2019ll try, & I don\u2019t care about getting off *every* time, I care that you *try*. & I said that I wasn\u2019t having sex with him until he made an effort to get me off because I\u2019m not a fleshlight for him to use whenever he wants. & he\u2019d bitch & moan about me not wanting to have sex w him every time he initiated & I looked him dead in the face & was like \u201cwhy would I be dying for sex w you when you don\u2019t give a damn about how sex is for ME?\u201d Like I\u2019m not going to this carnival if I\u2019m just gonna be the ride operator & you\u2019re the only one who gets to have fun on the rides.

That includes whether or not your girlfriend reduces her hours. I don't know what country you're in, but there are good ways to handle this and bad ways, and the financial ramifications are huge. It is 1,000% worth a few hours of somebody's time to make sure you get this right. Make sure you factor in any disability policies or SSDI that your girlfriend might receive if she's no longer able to work due to the permanent effects of her cancer treatments.\n\n\nSecond, the default mindset of the caretaker is to prioritize fighting the disease and the comfort of the patient above all else. I think that's what any loving partner would do, but it's so easy to lose your own identity and everything is about the sick partner. Well, you matter too!\n\n\nYou are 31 years old and your girlfriend, through no fault of her own of course, is now in a very different stage of life from you. She's 2 years younger and 30 years older than you, all at the same time. What were *your* plans and goals for life? How do you feel about this new life?\n\n\nJust to be clear, I am not advising you to leave your girlfriend. That's up to you. But what I am saying is that you need to take careful deliberation and own your decision so you don't wake up 20 years from now filled with regret.\n\n\nI don't know if it helps or not, but I'll add that Mrs. Anderson and I were already married and had kids by the time cancer struck. Yes, we stayed together, and no, it didn't even occur to me that leaving would make any sense, and no, I am not experiencing regret. But I'm me, and you are you.\u00a0\n\n\nApologies since I'm sure this came across as callous. But it's important information, and life isn't always rainbows and unicorns.

They worked with the short term disability program and submitted all the paperwork and as long as I went to therapy I got 65% of my weekly pay, which was more than part time work, even at my company. \n\n\nThis program has group therapy, individual therapy, nurses, doctor's, etc. My health insurance covered it and for what my copay was they let me pay a little each month.

I lost my father when I was 16. I've been exactly where you are so I hope I might be able to help you out here. Unfortunately, it's not all good.\n\nTeenagers tend to be fundamentally self-centered. No offense meant. It's just kind of a fact of nature. Most kids your age are completely unprepared to deal with something as serious and impactful as this. Their typical response will be to just ignore it. It's awful, but they're really not equipped to do much else. I'm sure you've noticed this in other areas. You probably feel that most of your peers are still living in a na\u00efve, childish world where everything is easy and the biggest concern is who is dating who. While you have been forced to grow up and face the real world.\n\nWhen my father died, I also lost my best friend and our small group that we hung out with. They stopped calling, stopped inviting me out, and I eventually quit trying. It was hard. It hurt a lot and it honestly still hurts a little bit. But as a result, I was forced to seek out new friends (I had social issues as well) and become much closer to the couple of acquaintances that didn't push me away. I found much kinder, empathetic, and overall better people to be friends with. Those people are still my best friends.\n\nI think you should reach out to your friend and tell her how you feel. Try not to be accusatory or attack her. Tell her that you're having a very hard time, you miss her, and you could really use her help getting you through this. Don't make it about the fact that she's been neglectful because that will just make her defensive. Make it about the fact that you need her help right now. She may step up to the task or she may not, but you should let her know that you need her help.\n\nIf it doesn't work out, you should know that there are so many other great and worthwhile people out there to make lifelong friendships with. Most people don't end up staying best friends with the friends they made at 4.

I walked towards the room very quietly while they went at it... of course they didn't hear me because they were far too \"deep\" in their actions. Luckily the door was halfway open so I got down and started crawling towards the bed out of their line of sight, slithered over to the edge of the bed they were closest to and started slowly inching my head up the side until just my eyes were above the edge. It took her a good minute (she was on the bottom) before she looked over and saw angry eyes staring at her. She freaked out so bad that she kicked the dude in the face and he fell off the bed and hit his head on the wall, she screamed louder than I've heard anyone scream in my life and bounced off the bed in a flailing, sweaty mess and I heard her ass hit the ground with a satisfying thud. I stood up and the guy was in a heap on the floor scared shitless at this dude in full military garb standing over him with crazy eyes.

Don't tolerate \"the crazy\"", "Wouldn't he have made more money by continuing to give the dog costly tests and treatments, rather than putting him down? If he had saved the dog, that would be years worth of check ups and other procedures that would have also been money in his pocket.\n\nYour girlfriend is delusional.", "I work in the medical field and it's not uncommon that people respond very poorly to sad things.  One of the most important tools in the arsenal is to restate their position in as generous a way possible.  ie, \"you had a pet that you and I both loved deeply, the pet died because of *whatever*.  You feel sad, I feel sad too.  You feel betrayed by a system that you thought would help your pet.  As best I can tell the reason you feel betrayed is because despite the tests ordered my friend was unable to help save your dog.  Since then you have decided that the vet took advantage of you.  Do you believe that the dog would be better off if had let him suffer?  I know you loved and still love your dog.  I can't imagine how much you hurt because your friend is gone.  (that's the phrase where people always start crying, so you gotta pause there) What is it about this situation that I don't understand?\"  You gotta listen at this point and pretty much exactly repeat back to them what they told you, then i usually ask if i understand it correctly.  The next step is where it gets tricky.  Usually i use this dialog because we're about to call security to pull a grieving mom off the floor cause she's flipping her biscuit (which is horrible and awful for everyone involved)  \"What are you presently trying to accomplish and what can I do to help you accomplish it?\"  At this point one of two things have happened.  Either they recognize that they are being irrational with their emotional responses to bystanders or they haven't.  Most of the time they'll be rational at this point, but sometimes they won't, so I'll then ask more pointed questions.  \"Will being cold to my good friend bring back your furry friend?  Does making everyone else around more miserable make you feel better?\"  Typically I have about a 90% success rate with this dialog for deescalating tense situations.  \n\nSometimes people feel like the best way of showing how much they love their lost one is by being a dick to everyone.  My best guess is that they do it to demonstrate that they loved more than decorum allows, so by violating social rules and norms they can show themselves and others that this is the case.  Once they figure out why they are being a dick it usually settles down.  Good luck man.  Let us know how it turns out.\n\nEDIT: Oh one more thing.  REASON DOES NOT APPLY.  Forcing ultimatums will only give her a venue to further demonstrate how deeply she feels/loves whatever.  Grief makes people dumb.  I'm not justifying her behavior but man, if i had 2 bucks every time I experienced something like this in the face of loss I could pay off my student loans easily.   If you try to guide the logic of a grieving person you'll just come off as manipulative and she'll probably entrench herself deeper in the delusion.  You can't give them the obvious conclusions even though you totally want to. All you are trying to do is build up the idea that you know that they love the departed and you can't possibly feel as awful as she does because no one feels as deeply as she can (even though it's probably not true). ", "This sounds like it is more of an issue with your girlfriend's grief and her difficulty processing it. Losing a pet, especially one that still so young, is really sad and your girlfriend has a right to her feelings. What she doesn't have a right to is to control who you can and can't be friends with. I would encourage your girlfriend to talk to someone to help her deal with the grief of losing her dog, but I'd also stand your ground and back your friend up. Malpractice is a pretty serious accusation and it sounds like your girlfriend's grief is clouding her judgement.

Is there a better way for me to be handling that?\" \"The document she produced needed an extra two hours of editing before we could give it to the client.\" Act in the manner that you aren't complaining, simply giving him information about how things are going and if this is what he wants then that's fine with you. \n\nAnd if he indicates that he doesn't want to hear negative things, then stop going down that road for your own sake.

The only thing that worked was to say \"hey, I'm in a meeting right now, we'll talk later,\" like a stuck record every time he tried asking a question or saying it would only take a second or whatever.\n\nI think what I would do at this point is set up a regular meeting slot with her- daily, weekly, every other day, w/e- and then turn down any meeting requests outside of it. If she keeps asking to meet, just tell her your next meeting with her is on [DATE].\n\nIf she asks questions, ask what she thinks she should do (quickest way I've found to redirect stuff like this!)

I'm 95% sure it's just the anxiety talking and you don't actually believe this, but from now on I'm going to start saying these things only once per conversation.

Don't do this. At least not if you are trying to pretend like everything is okay. You are in trauma and processing a lot of things. There is going to be shame and embarrassment.\n\nStep 1: take screenshots of everything between them. If you tell them, they might try to deny it, erase the evidence and call you crazy.\n\nStep 2: take back your holiday. Seriously, fuck trying to keep the peace. Tell your parents that your sister is fucking your fiance and that you will not spend Christmas with either of them. Offer screenshot proof. Make alternate plans for christmas at a friend's house.\n\nHold a boundary that you will not be around either of them. You will be 10 x more miserable if you try to hold out and have this fight after Christmas. You didn't ruin the holidays, they did.", "To start with if this is 100% what is happening. End it. That level of deceit, dishonesty and disregard for your feelings is not acceptable in any way no matter the time together.    \n    \nSecondly, start thinking practically. Screenshots, take them and save them to a flash drive. Images, messages, all of it. It will be hart to look at but do it. You need proof, you may not think it but you will. Financially. This is hard I know. Chanel that hurt your feeling and make it cold as ice. I assume you\u2019re living together and share some items. What you need to do around those needs to be decided and doing so in advance will save issues later down the line.    \n    \nThird, make a decision. Can you handle that at your family home for x-mas?\n", "First of all, I am so sorry this has happened to you. What your fiance and sister have done is inexcusable, hurtful and morally repugnant. I know this pain is intense, but thank your lucky stars that you have discovered the truth. No longer do you have to waste anymore time (and a marriage no less) on your soon-to-be ex nor do you have to nurture a relationship with a spiteful sibling. You're about to lose some dead weight; you are about to cut out two very hurtful and deceitful people from your life. \n\nIn regards to your relationship, you know what you need to do. You must end it. Someone who would lie and cheat on you has no love or respect for you. This creep not only cheated, but also embarked on this ugly escapade with someone he knew you were close to: your sister. He chose to hurt you, play you and then pursue a future with you all while screwing around with your sibling. This is unforgivable behavior and reveals how completely selfish and manipulative your fiance is. Cut off this engagement as soon as possible then completely block this guy from all your social media. He isn't the loving caring man you thought he was. He is a liar; he is jerk. \n\nBefore you break up with this man, take the other advice given here and gather evidence. Get a thumb drive and transfer all screen shots of dirty pictures, facebook messages and any videos onto it. Yes, it will suck beyond belief to go through these images, but it will benefit you in the long run. It provides you with proof against the fiance and sister when they try to make excuses for their behavior, or straight up lie to you about it. Also, as awful as this sounds, if mom and dad don't believe you, well, you'll have the evidence of the affair to share with them. (Hopefully, it will not come to that). \n\nI also advise you to split up any joint bank accounts. Move all your assets into a private account that only you can touch. If you're sharing an apartment (which it sounds like you are) talk to your landlord about the lease agreement. I'd honestly move out in your shoes. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere near my cheating ex. If the majority of the lease is paid by you or in your name, then the ex fiance can go. This is really your call here. Either kick him out or relocate. Legal advice reddit will have more knowledge on this front. \n\nIn terms of Christmas, I would not be heading home to spend it with your sister. Once you have all your evidence, I think you should call or Skype your parents. Tell them everything. Let them know that you will not be doing anything with your sister for the foreseeable future. That what your sister has done has hurt you in an unimaginable way, and that it is your sister's responsibility to mend her relationship with you not yours. I'd even go as far as to say this, \"Mom and Dad, I would still love to spend Christmas with you guys, but if sister is going to be there then I will not be going. I am not emotionally ready to deal with her deception or the pain she has caused right now. I also don't know when I will be in a place where I'll want anything to do with her either. I hope you both can understand and respect that.\" \n\nIf your parents try to say, \"No, sister would never do that\" then provide them with evidence. Don't allow yourself to be guilted into forgiving your sister or to attend a holiday where her very presence will cause you more heartbreak. You need to put yourself first now. I'm hoping your parents will be sensible and compassionate towards your situation. If they end up defending your sister, you should cut ties with them for awhile as well. You don't need anymore stress, pain or ugliness in your life right now. What you do need is time to heal. \n\nLastly, confront both the fiance and sister with all the things you have found. (Perhaps do this with a trusted friend or two around that will offer you support). Tell them you're through with both of them. If your sister begins to cry, let her. Remind her that she threw away her relationship with you to cheat with your fiance. She helped cause this rift and you, frankly, cannot trust her anymore. Also remind her that this isn't something sisters do to each other (let alone friends) and that you are going no contact for awhile. \n\nAs for the fiance, tell him you are done. Tell him you are either moving out or he is (this depends on the lease agreement and what you decide in regards to that). Then you know what you should do? Give him the engagement ring. Tell him marriage and love are things you find sacred, and you will not spend your life shackled to a liar that transformed those delicate sentiments into a mockery. You deserve better than him. After this, you can either leave with your things all packed or kick your sister and ex out of your apartment. Make sure if you keep said apartment that you also change the locks. You don't want either of them having a key either. \n\nWhen the dust settles, remind yourself you did nothing wrong. You were betrayed and cruelly so. Take all the time you need to heal. Travel. Pursue new hobbies. Hang out with friends. Make new friends. Maybe even consider some therapy too because what you've experienced would shake anyone up. You'll get through this OP. I know you will. Take care, okay? And know that real love is waiting. Good luck.  ", "Holy crap. Okay. As painful and miserable as this is and is going to be for the next few weeks, please remember: **you dodged a bullet, sister.** \n\nYou *didn't* marry a sociopathic cheater who would have undoubtedly ruined your life. He may ruin your Christmas, he's certainly going to fuck up your relationship with your sister (she sounds completely jealous of you, really-that's why siblings usually fuck spouses/partners of family members)  ....but you didn't spend the next decade with some kind of creep who would have made you miserable, in the end. \n\nTime for a big discussion with your fianc\u00e9 and your sister, if not an actual PowerPoint presentation. Time to call a counselor. Time for a heart to heart with your parents. Time to save all those nudes and photos in case they try to talk you out of what you saw (delete them afterwards, along with your engagement to this guy). \n\nEDIT: I mean you confront both of them, and dump him, at the same time. Not try to work out. Sorry if I expressed that somewhat murkily. \n", ">I've consumed more alcohol in the past 24 hours than in the past 6 months\n\nI'd be drinking too.  Do yourself a favor?

I hope we can work together on this to make sure she does the necessary work.\n\nMy daughter and I both understood the goal of this assignment to be to research and learn about her family's culture. [Reference the exact wording on the assignment.] Is this correct? \n\nOur family's culture is not tied to our country of origin. Although this is somewhat unique among those of us of European descent, our family's cultural identity is Jewish. The Jewish identity is not only a religion, and culturally distinct from any individual country, even Israel. I know this can be confusing for people not already familiar with it. I'd be happy to discuss it further with you and answer any questions you may have. This is why my daughter turned in an assignment showing her research on this cultural group, and not a country. As far as the assignment was communicated with me, I believe my daughter's work fulfills the basic requirement.\n\nMy daughter has told me that you have asked her to redo this assignment and research a specific country. Is that correct? Again, she and I understood that the assignment was about culture. [Reference the original wording?] Did you clarify this in person in class?\n\nIt looks to me like we have a misunderstanding related to the specific requirements of this assignment: culture or country. Of course, if the assignment handout said country, or you told the class in person that they had to research a country, my daughter and I misunderstood and she needs to redo the assignment. But if the assignment was to research her family's culture, than I respectfully assure you she has done exactly that and ask that you grade her work accordingly. It is both fair and necessary for her to redo the assignment if she misunderstood, but it is not fair for her to do more work because her family's culture is not tied to her country of origin.\n\nOr I wonder if it's possible that the assignment said culture, but maybe you have a learning outcome or curriculum requirement regarding researching countries that the class has to fulfill? In this case, I understand the need for her to meet that requirement. But as she completed the project as assigned, I don't believe it is fair to ask her to repeat her work. Is there a smaller supplementary assignment she might complete to fulfill the same objective?\n\nI hope you understand that I am not seeking special accommodations for my daughter. I'm looking to see if there is a misunderstanding at play that we can resolve without adding extra work to your plate or hers. Ultimately, she needs to fulfill the same educational objective as her peers.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on the subject.\n\nThanks,\n\nEtc.", "I think you're making the right decision here.

I remember other kids talking and getting excited about where their families came from while I had to confront the reality, at 11 years old, that I'd never know that kind of information or get excited about my ancestral language. \nLater confrontations revealed that my 4th grade teacher was more than a little racist, but it took my mom standing up for me publicly, for me to take pride in the mystery and struggle of my lineage. I'll always love her for that to be honest. I don't let people give me shit about the color of my skin TODAY because of the resolve my mother showed in that parent teacher meeting.\nSo I mean, I hope that helps?", "Why is everyone downvoting the OP? This is a perfectly legit reason to be annoyed with the teacher. I'm a former teacher, and if my instructions were not specific enough that was on me, not my students.

Things like this are a learning experience for the teacher - it's not the student's fault. \n\nI would politely email the teacher (maybe CC the principal?) and say that the instructions weren't clear, your daughter put a lot of work into the assignment, and if she could turn it in as she had already done it. You can reference your Jewish ancestry and point out that like many other ethnic minorities, your people come from various countries (and Israel is not one of them).

If your daughter were to write about Israel, she'd have to write the country pre-diaspora, not as it exists now.  If you want to keep fighting this, just go above the teacher's head.  \n\nIf you really want to be a pain in the ass about it, redo the assignment and haul out ever shit thing Russia or Poland did to the Jewish people.

Shit, I'm 28 and just learned a better way to chop up onions and I eat onions like every damn day. \n\n Of course she doesn't mind the idea of taking on two more kids because so far she has it easy peasy with the three kids you already have. That's cool that she's a great mother, but you guys need to set up a real system that she needs to follow to help take some of the pressure off of you even if you DON'T end up taking care of these other kids.\n\nThink about the ideal situation here in your mind - even if your wife suddenly cooked dinner every night and kept the house clean, would you be willing to take on two more kids, or no? \n\nIt's okay to say no.

Your sister lost custody, your in-laws were granted guardianship.  So first, consult an attorney for the exact details... but if you take over guardianship of the girls via the foster system - you'd get paid by the state for their care.  \n\n2.  With the additional burden of two dependents, you may yourselves qualify for state aid like food stamps - thus freeing up a bit of cash for other necessities.\n\n3.  Get on Craigslist, in the \"Services > Household\" section, and hire yourself someone to come in and clean weekly.  These people offer their services for between $15-20/hour, and a decent one should be able to have your home sparkling in 3-4 hours.  \n\n4.  If you go through the system to take in your nieces, you'd also probably qualify for respite care.  That's where the girls go visit another foster family on some weekends... which would give you free time to relax, focus on just your three, etc.\n\n5.  Your kids aren't doing enough chores.  I tell you this as a mother who raised three kids... your kids aren't doing enough chores.  Every one of them should have a bunch of chores, even the youngest.  If you look online, there are an absolute TON of sites with lists of age-appropriate chores - USE THEM.\n\n6.  Stop making dinner when you come home from work.  There are hundreds of sites online that show you how to spend ONE DAY A MONTH prepping meals for an entire month's worth of dinners... and tons of those meals are crock-pot meals, where you dump them out of a freezer bag and into the crock pot before you leave for work in the morning, and you have a delicious dinner ready when you get home.  Cooking this way is cheaper, easier, and less stressful than whatever you are currently doing, GUARANTEED.  Your wife is probably smart enough to handle doing the actual grocery shopping for your \"day of cooking,\" so give her that part.  And get that woman involved in couponing.\n\nFinally... you're in a panic, because this is all so overwhelming.  Stop and take a breath.  Take another.  Now... stop REacting, and begin **researching** the things I've talked about here.

I hope you never doubt your decision to do that. \n\nWhen I was 22, my parents gave me the same ultimatum, for the same reasons, and I ended up in treatment 2 states away. I relapsed after treatment, while still in that state and tiny treatment town, and thankfully that was short lived. My sobriety date is 2 days after my birthday, and I just recently got 3 years sober. I can't tell you how much I wish your update was a happier one, and I really can't put into words how sorry I truly am for not only you and your family, but also your daughter. The guilt and shame addicts experience once they get sober is honestly awful. It can and has lead to relapses since we don't know how to properly deal with our emotions anymore, we numbed them for so long.\n\nI've lost way too many friends to heroin, having been in their shoes, it's important that I remember that they're no longer suffering. I hope that you and your family find peace someday. You did the best thing you could have ever done for her. I'm so sorry. ", "I am so sorry for your loss. The following is about my sister, a decades long opiate user. Please feel free to come back to it at a later time if you don't want to read it now, its fairly personal.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment, while statistically \"the best\" solution also gas a great number of undisclosed downsides that come in with the individuals who aren't there to get better. The first time my sister entered treatment, she said it was a great way to learn to be a better criminal/addict. \n\nIts also a place where the more intelligent kids whose families have the means to send them to treatment get a sincere dose of the reality of their plight. \n\nIt is impossible to equip a family for this, it is impossible to prepare for this, and it is impossible to imagine this, from start to finish. I can tell you with a straight face that your daughter may have truly believed she was doing the right thing for you. Opiate addiction is an unimaginable illness.\n\nMy sister never had the chance to go to treatment, my family doesnt have that kind of money. She struggled, mostly on the street, for the better part of the past 15 years. She has been a prostitute as well a pimp. A drug runner and a drug dealer. And anything else you can imagine. She finally started begging the probation system for rehab in 2011. She got about 21 days, once. That was it. There's simply no such thing as treatment for a single, indigent woman. \n\nMy sister is finally recovering. All it took was 20 weeks in ICU (broken over three years), a colostomy bag, nearly losing not one, but both of her hands, staph infections, removal of bone, nearly dying several times, I kidnapped her, all the methadone, smuggling suboxone, you name it and finally, after having every single person finally turn their backs on her - including me, the final hold out. After shutting the door for a year, she started crawling out, without my help.\n\nShe became very motivated last year and knew of a way to get herself off the street. She got knocked up, out of desperation. Suddenly, she had a bed in a rehab facility. Suddenly, she had benefits. Suddenly, she had all of these doors flying open. I was still amazed she managed to conceive. \n\nAnd she is really, actually doing it. I haven't had to enable her in any way. We live in Colorado, she doesn't even mess with dabbling in weed anymore, and she is a drug addict straight out of a textbook. \n\nShe fears homelessness more than she fears withdrawal. That's what it seems like it came down to. Its that fear that keeps it going. For her it seems like she had to fear something more, but it didn't become the homelessness and poverty until something more important than her was at stake.\n\nThat sounds positive, and it is, in its way. She still has a struggle ahead as a single mom, but for the first time in 15 years I believe she's clean. I don't check on her, she's been solid as a rock for over a year now. She doesn't lie, shes punctual (probably the biggest tell), and she's fat. The fetus seems healthy, she's due new years.\n\nBut the overall cost, the emotional cost, all that trauma, all the hospital nights, the lying. There were times when I begged her, while she lay unconscious and intubated in front of me, not to come back. I would tell her, after a decade of dealing with her addiction, that it was OK if she quit this time. I would understand. I promised her I would be really sad and it would be really hard, but going through this every year was just too hard anymore. I begged her to just stay asleep. \n\nI would have been happy with her at peace. It is just a motherfucker of an illness. I probably understand it better than anyone who has never tried it, and I don't really know how to convey it. I know my sister. I know she is in such a tiny set of the population of opiate addicts who get to recover, and so does she.\n\nI used to write about it a lot under a different moniker, but she still has a ways to go. She's on the methadone replacement still, the child will be born an addict. We will have to work with doctors to help the baby kick the single worst opioid out there. Hopefully we get it over with early. I do not have kids, but I do have a lot of infant experience.\n\nShe doesn't live with me and I will still never let her into my life in that way. She lives in a private, sober living residence for homeless, single mothers, where she can stay until the baby is 3 months old, then she is out on her own. Her completion of a previous program for pregnant mothers as well as her participation in a study with CU is helping with housing (think section 8) for a couple of years and other odds and ends. That's all privately funded, there's tons of support out there for single mothers, it turns out. \n\nIts an outcome. I do not have expectations of smooth skies ahead, that will maybe never exist, but at least she will have a healthy child at this point. \n\nPlease get your son to see someone. If yes young with no drug experience, get him a proper, fact based education in the topic. This can't continue to be about the scary boogey man heroin, the most evil drug ever. It isn't about that. Its about education and getting them to make responsible decisions, not using scare tactics. She's a walking scare tactic - her arms are visibly half missing - and that isn't enough to scare kids she's met.\n\nIm sorry, this is wordy. Having lived with this with two of my siblings, as well as the suicide of my 22 year old brother, in a certain light I hear where they were or would be coming from. \n\nIt really is peace. I've seen this every way. It is devastating but it does get easier. It will always hurt, but it will get better. I really hate that anyone has to go through this, no matter how long or short. \n\nThe people who are attracted to opiates tend to be the sweeter, kinder, more sensitive ones. The pain of the world is a lot, to them. They aren't scary or waiting to wrong anyone, they don't want to get sick. ", "oh Jesus. I'm sorry op, I'm so sorry.

Perhaps you don't even have to regret your anger.\n\nTry to remember *why* you got so angry.\n\nIt seems like you first got angry when at the mere thought that he might not get half the money, he blow up at you. That revealed that his first and perhaps only priority was to get his cut. There was no consern at all over how this money could effect you or both of your lives, only \"me me me\". Honestly, if that money had been be spent so you could working less, or invested in your future or on a nice getaway for the two of you it would have benefited him alot and he should have been grateful for that. Even spending a large chunk of it on something nice for just you would have been fair as appriciation for all the hard work you've put in to support your household. But he only cared about what he felt was owed him and what he wanted. You're damn right to be angry at that! How selfish can he be?\n\nThen you got angry because he tried to pressure and manipulate you into getting what he wanted. No compromise and no consern for what you might want or think, but again it was \"me me me\". Only more because now he wasn't only upset that he wasn't getting \"his\" money, but actually trying to figure out how to get \"his\" money from you without your approval. He didn't care how you felt about it if he got a car out of it. This feels little better than theft, but via entitlement and manipulation instead of ouright stealing it. Again, your anger is extremly justifiable.\n\nThen you were conviced that as long as you had the money he would never stop trying to take it. Always looking for a new way to get to the money and not caring what it did to you or your relationship. Of course you got rid of it! It was self preservation to stop him from tearing throug you to get to your money.\n\nIt might have been done in anger, but it was an anger born from needing to fight for yourself. There are different kinds of anger, and not all of them are bad. Some gives us the courage to stand up for ourseves or the strenght to do something difficult. It really feels like this was a *rightous anger*, and you shouldn't regret it.\n\nYou reacted to your bfs disgraceful behaviour with anger on now this is the situation you're in. Are you going to pretend your anger wasn't normal and justifiable in this situation and apologies? Are you going to take the blame for the situation you bf relentlessly pushed you into? Or a you going to tell him what you did without fear and shame and tell him that his selfish and manipulative behaviour cost him a car and is about to cost him his girlfriend too?\n\nYour action of giving away money without consulting your bf because you're worried what he'll do to get to it is not worse than him trying to get the money by (almost) any means necessary for his own selfish reasons. Far from it. Please think this through before you start apologising to him or trying to find way to make it up to him. Remember your anger.

Had he changed his behavior since finding our about the money? \n\nIf he's really broke maybe he's just immature and excited about seeing more possibilities for fun in the future, but than in itself is kinda worrisome, because it seems he might be into spending your money little more than you are.

The longer your family is allowed to believe this, the worse it will get when you say \"no\".", "You're not under an obligation to take them in.\n\nNormally my advice would be about family, and love, and its not the kid's fault, and keeping everyone together is worth a little discomfort and adjustment.  But this isn't one or two kids.\n\nThis is potentially *six*.\n\nWhich would bring your total number of children to *eight*.\n\nThat's not a small adjustment.  That's a major life shift.  That's a new house, new vehicles, second or third jobs to afford everything shift.  I know of very few people who could afford - literally afford - to suddenly expand their family from four to ten.\n\nI think, in this case, letting the foster system take the children in is in everyone's best interests.

I'd say let her hit rock bottom and reach out for help but she's there now and seems to be enjoying it.  I think it may be best for the kids to be away from her and that house for a while.

I don't need to go into the reasons why, as everyone seems to have already covered that, but it is probably safe to say that you can rule that out as an option. \n\nHowever, you can still be there in ways that matter. If the kids are split up (which they probably will be) you can provide a hub for them to all come together and keep in contact with each other. You can provide support, guidance and the knowledge that they have a solid (sane!) family member who cares about them. Talk with CPS when the time comes and let them know how much you're willing to do and stay in regular contact with the kids. \n\nI know this all seems sort of obvious but there seem to be a lot of 'this isn't your problem' type messages on this thread and whilst I very much doubt you feel that way because of the amount you do already; I just wanted to press the general point that they deserve someone to care. I have family members and work with children who came through the care system and I dread to think what would have happened to those kids if they didn't have some form of loving family behind them.\n\nIt sounds like what you're doing for the kids already is amazing - and most importantly, you care about them. Keep on that track and you'll be doing right by them.    ", "It's not clear where you live, but taking in six kids is no joke.

Just as a limb doesn't grow back, the part of ourselves that we lose when a partner dies doesn't grow back.  There is no \"right\" amount of time to grieve, because each person is different, and each relationship is different.  You will probably be grieving to some extent for the rest of your life, and anyone who tells you that you should be \"over it\" in a year, or five, or ten, is a fool. You are already feeling the same sort of phantom pain that an amputee feels, but in an emotional sense rather than a physical sense.  A future relationship (if or when you feel ready for one) may (probably will) feel strange, not because it's not good, but because it's not *her*.\n\nJust as with the loss of a limb, you have to re-learn how to do things; the old ways of living life, which you had gotten used to for the past 15 years, are not going to work any more.  Things may get \"easier\" in the sense that you will find new ways of doing things, as a person coping with an injury finds new ways of doing them, but that's adaptation, not recuperation.  You can't use both hands to open a jar if you don't have two hands any more, and even if you find a new way to open that jar, it's still not the way you'd done it all your life until you lost the hand.\n\nPart of my role within my spiritual community is as an end-of-life counselor, both for those who are facing their own deaths and those who are coping with the death of a loved one.

I'm a 49-years old dad with a 15-years old boy. I'm not a kid who aligns with another kid. I am writing from the perspective of a teenager's  parent.\n\nSo, you are grounded. And what are your guilts?\n\n1) being in love with a guy she approved. \nReally can't see the guilt here. \n\n> \"she was worried I was \"in love\" with him, \" \n\nThat phrase is really worrying. She is projecting on you her experiences, and wants to align your life to the equation love=evil. i.e. she wants to project in your life her (probably sad) story, making your life sad too\n\nI mean, she's ok with you having sex but not you loving the guy? Are we kidding? \n\n2) writing about suicide. \n\nI know you sometimes just write down thisgs to let the steam out, but just for the sake of argument, let's assume you were serious and really wrote \"I am killing myself. I'll do it with a chainsaw, on wednesdday\". (full intention, planning, technical details. you don't get more seriuos than that)\n\nAs I was saying, even if it were so, that's something you HELP people for, not PUNISH them.\n\n3) keeping a diary. \n\nThat's all the sense I can get from her \"betraying her trust and not talking to her about problems this serious.\"\n\nShe has hard time accepting the fact you are growing into an adult and you are therefore detaching from her and keeping things private. \n\nShe's a mum who has lived alone with her daughter for ~~24~~ 9 years, building a \"we only\" world around. The idea of you having your own life SEPARATE from hers, is probably terrifying for her. \n\nIt's understandable. But that's nature. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE KIDS IN THE FIRST PLACE: to make them into responsible, independant adults.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nYou are understandably hurt, and all this is rather devastating for your immediate life. I understand this. You should TRY (and it'll be hard) not to have the pain/betrayal/anger take you over.\n\nSpeak to her like the adult you are becoming.\n\n===============\n\nMom, I understand you are worried about what I wrote about suicide. As I told you, it's just stuff I wrote to vent. Nevertheless, if you want me to go to therapy, I'll do it.\n\nWhat I have a hard time understanding is that you are punishing me for starting turning into an adult. I don't think it's a guilt to have feelings for Jared. You approved him, you were cool with us having sex, but now that I have feelings you want me to break up with him? That's what adults do: have feelings for their partners. Please tell me what do you want me to do. Do you want to find another guy to have sex with, as long as feelings are not involved?\n\nThe same is for \"betraying your trust\". Did I lie to you? Did I hid from you things that I did? I am a teenager that is growing up and start feeling the need for her OWN space. Private space. That's what adult have and need. That's what every teenager has and needs, in order to find out and work out its real adult personality. Can't I have this?\"\n\n===============\n\nI know it will not not be possible to say all this in these calm ways. Perhaps you could write her. It'll e hard. She does not realize the is being overly projecting and controlling, and that she is jeopardizing your future relationship. Have her talk to others (your granparents, a counselor / other figure of authority ... for example, from church if you go there) She needs to speak about this WITH ANOTHER ADULT\n\nThese behaviours (i.e. expecting the daughter to have NO life unless it's with the mother) make me think of a narcissist disorder. Head to /r/raisedbynarcissists and see if the horror there resonates with your case. Especially the links in the sidebar (unless you are on mobile, and in this case I think the sidebar does not show, just google for the characteristics of narcissistic mothers)\n\nShe seems a nice mom in other occasions... How was your father? Maye HE was the \n narcissist, and  it's just FLEAS ? (again, see the sidebar or lookup up narcissism FLEAS ) \n\nIt'll be hard. But you are becoming an adult, and you can face that. You have to work this out like an adult.\n\nAnd Jared ..... That's difficoult. Talk to him, explain him the situation, explain him that you need help from him, and that your mom needs help from you. Do NOT tell him \"I'm breaking up with you because my mom told me so\" That's not what an adult would do. \n\nTell him something along \"I don't want to lose you, but please be patient. I need to work through this hard time, I have to do this alone but  I would like to be able to think that I a doing this for us too, that you are with me, that you'll be there at  the end of the tunnel\". \n\nThat's how adult partners speak to each other when shit happens. And I understand you now feel in a storm of shit.\n\nBest wishes. Be strong. Be proud of yourself. She should be proud of you.\n\nBTW: It's good for you to go to therapy, because if the therapist is a minimally reasonable  person she will help you through this with your mom. If you see the therapist is an ok person, you COULD try and have the therapist talk to your mom to detach you from HER baggage. SHE needs help more than you.\n\n", "A journal isn't meant to be taken at face-value, that's why they're meant to be very personal and private. Sometimes you need to express your chain of consciousness, let out all your crazy feelings and thoughts and then go back to look at them later and form a better context for your feelings and maybe learn something about yourself. It's a tool for personal growth. So for someone to go through your journal and then judge you for what you wrote, and even take punitive measures against you is more than wrong, it's unforgivable in my opinion. I've been married to my wife for 14 years and we share everything about each other. We fart in front of each other and babble nonsense when our minds wander, but I would never look through her journal unless she wants me to see something. Why? Because I know it's not something I could read and understand where she is coming from and what it means. Many times journal entries don't have meaning, it's just venting.\n\nEveryone should know this. Most people respect this.

I had that childhood but even just 7 years later the memories seem far away, like they belong to someone else. Bless your heart for giving a fuck about this girl. To this day, I remember that most people knew just enough about us to just think we were an incredibly well-behaved, if odd, family. But I do remember once a woman and her husband who lived in our neighborhood that we really liked, offering (in a really cryptic way) that if I (and my other sisters of similar teenage age) ever needed it we had a place to stay, we had one with them.\n\nAt the time, I was so damn brainwashed I was puzzled as to why she offered. I didn't rebel against the lifestyle of my parents until I was 18 and it was as if the scales suddenly fell off my eyes. I moved to a large city and lived among normal people, who my family had convinced me were all lesser, and amoral, and discovered the pack of lies and brainwashing I'd been fed. That said, I had been deeply depressed and suicidal since the age of 13. When I realized later in life that even just one person recognized the hell of a life we lived, that someone cared - well, it made a difference in my mind. That was one bright spot in a time in my life where there weren't many.\n\nI struggled with the FAFSA issue as well. First two years after I was cut off from my parents, nobody would provide me parental info. I hate the way that system is set up, it's garbage. Half of the people I know their parents didn't even contribute to their education. The ones who were in my position even were told there was no recourse. It was infuriating and upsetting at a time when I was dealing with a lot.\n\nEither way, thank you for your compassion for this girl. She will never forget it. Morally or on principle there is nothing wrong with what you're looking to do. I think your husband is wrong about \"undermining\" her parents. But practically speaking, if her parents find out and make her life hell or kick her out, are you going to offer her a place to stay? I will say that at least right now she's allowed to see and spend time with a normal kid like your daughter. We were never allowed to have friends because they might \"corrupt\" us. If Rose's family decides after all this that she can't hang out with your family or any normal people anymore, that would be horrible for her at that age where she's yearning for freedom. Just things to think about.\n\n", "First off, you and your family sound great, helping Rose in these regards is a wonderful and important thing to be doing. I'd agree with you that you should encourage and allow what you've posted about here. It sounds like Rose is in an incredibly stressful and quite toxic environment at home, and anything that you can do to help her out, let her experience what she should be able to, etc... is a great thing. ", "I think it's a good thing you want to help her. \n\nI suppose in doing these things you are undermining Rose's parents, as your husband said, but thats not always a bad thing. For example, if Rose's parents physically beat her and you allowed her to hide in your house til they calmed down it would still be undermining them, but that doesn't mean its a bad thing. I'm sure your husband would agree with that. Rose's case in reality may not be so extreme (at least physically) but I think her case justifies it.\n\nSome may say she should just wait a couple years to do these herself, but to a depressed teenager that would feel soooo far away. I really feel for this poor girl.\n\nThe most concerning issue I srr with this is that if Rose's family found out she did any of this stuff she would likely be thrown out and disowned. That's serious shit. If you're careful it'd probably be avoided but that's still a big risk.\n\nIf you go through with this I really think you should get your daughter to teach Rose how to swim when the weathers good enough. Thats dangerous as hell that she doesn't know how. Not knowing how to swim could actually kill her one day.\n\nAlso, if you go through with this just be sure you never ever give her alcohol while she's underage.

Has anyone been to another party recently where something was stolen? \n\nAlso, look online to see if some of the items have been posted for sale on craigslist or ebay. You're probably not dealing with a criminal mastermind here. Definitely go to the cops, but understand that they cannot help you as much as you can help yourself.\n\nCheck your renters policy. Call Meredith, explain what happened, the options moving forward you are aware of and apologize. Sincerely apologize, with no exceptions. Do not surprise her with felony level theft when she gets home. You want her to react before she sees you so she has the chance to be calm when you first talk about it in person. Include her in the process and show her you are working to make things right. She will be angry, and you are liable for what happened.

I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n\nHope that helps. Im sorry for your loss.", "I lost my love suddenly too. So I know where you are. I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nMy advice is to grieve fully. But don't make my mistake. Please get a counselor or someone to talk to and work this through. Please no matter what you do don't turn to drink or substance. As the years go by, honor her by living well.\n\n(hugs) I understand. It's not okay and it will never be ok. ", "When I was 18 I found out my boyfriend (19) died because when I called his phone it was the coroner who answered. He was in a motorcycle accident on the way to my house. I am very very sorry for your loss. It might not seem like it now, but I promise you that with time it will get better. I wish I had more comforting things to say but stay strong, remember the good times, and I promise you will be okay. Feel free to PM me if you ever need to. Sorry again. ", "First\n off, I am so sorry for your loss. I cant even imagine how you must feel. You will get tons of messages, but you dont have to reply or feel likebyou need to do anything back. Everyone experiences grief differently so do not concern yourself with how you should be acting. You are in shock and it will take time.  \n\nIt sounds like between her family and your family you have a good support network. They are experiencing the same flood of emotions, so talk to them. Your parents are there to support you even when the world seems to collapse, so utilize that support.\n\nIn the short term, there isnt a right answer. Do what your instinct tells you to do. In the long term, think about grief counseling to start the healing process. \n\nBest of luck.  ", "Oh honey. I am so sorry. I've been where you are. I lost my boyfriend of several years when I was 23. We were building a life together, getting ready to move in together. I was crushed. So I understand. \n\nFirst thing, people are asking you right now what they can do for you. Your parents have asked, or maybe a sibling. The answer is that they can run interference for you. Ask your mom to return calls to friends and family, let them know that you appreciate their calls, but that you're not ready to talk to anyone yet. Same with email, messages, whatever. Ask someone else to deal with them for you. \n\nSecond, ask people to either stay with you so you don't have to be alone, or leave you alone because you can't be with others right now. You know best what you need. It's ok to ask for it. After my boyfriend died, I drank Scotch with one of my not-that-close friends and watched shitty funny movies. I knew this friend would be Ok just sitting with me, letting me laugh or cry as I needed, and wouldn't make me feel more than I was ready to. Maybe try to find that person in your life and hang out with them. It may not be the person you immediately think of. \n\nThird, denial is an Ok thing. There's a reason we as a species developed it as a coping mechanism. If it helps you feel better to pretend for a little while that you're Ok, then pretend away, buddy. The sorrow will catch up with you eventually. You don't have to embrace it just yet if you're not ready. \n\nFourth, think about seeing a shrink. Sometimes it can help to have someone to talk to. \n\nFifth, I want you to know that you're going to be Ok. You'll never be the same. This is something that will haunt you forever and affect you in ways that you can't appreciate yet. But it will also make you a better person if you let it. Life is precious and impermanent. Loving your girlfriend was a wonderful part of your life, and it's your job now to take all of the incredible things you learned from her and go on to live an amazing rest of your life. You owe it to her to live and love enough for the both of you. You'll be Ok, in time. \n\nWhen my boyfriend died, I thought that was it for me. I didn't think I'd ever love anyone as much as I loved him. That was almost 10 years ago. 5 years ago I got married. I had a baby a year ago. My life is rich and full in ways I never imagined it could have been. Loving my boyfriend helped pave the way for loving my husband, and losing my boyfriend has made me so much more grateful for the life I have now. I'm grateful every day, because I know how easy it is for it to go away. I never take this happiness for granted, ever. And that's the gift my boyfriend's death gave me, the gift of appreciation. \n\nSo hang in there. It gets easier, I promise. The Hurt never goes away, but the pain becomes less relevant to your everyday life over time, and what you're left with is that immense feeling of love and gratitude. It takes time, but it comes. \n\nI hope your healing is as swift and gentle as it can be. Pm me if you want to talk. I'm happy to listen.

You being in counseling is a very good thing, keep going. The numbness is concerning.  I believe that too will pass with time. \n\n When my husband cheated on me, I actually grieved the death of my marriage for many months. You had a good marriage, just as I did. It's not easy, even all this time later, to remember how happy we were and how much I lost. \n\n The same will happen to your children, if not now, then in time. My only concern would be that they are not honest with their feelings, due to their loyalty to you. So again, hopefully with time, they will be able to forgive their mother. That's going to be a huge part of the healing they need to do. And that has nothing to do with her, and everything to do with their own mental health and well-being. She may never know whether or not she was forgiven. It's interior to, and important for, them. \n\nI wish you all the best.\n\n", "Hi, OP. I was your twins in this situation. About 8 years ago I caught my mother cheating on my father. They had been together nearly 30 years at the time.\n\nIt was an affair that everyone knew about except for my dad and us kids. Literally after the divorce friends of my dad began commenting that they had seen my mother at gatherings were couple were expected, only to find her there \"alone\". I found it through texts after she had told me to look for an old message on her phone. \n\nI told my dad because I loved both my parents, but I didn't love one more than the other.\n\nMy mother wasn't remorseful until she realized my father was going to go through with the divorce. She then turned vengeful; demanding money, claiming abuse, and eventually went to our vacation house and family home without warning in order to take things that she wanted (not just her things but all of our baby pictures, fine China left to me by my grandmother, and things like our everyday dinnerware).\n\nMy father loved my mother dearly and he couldn't bring himself to leave her high and dry (though our state says infidelity = no right to alimony) so he purchased her a home, car, and furniture. She was basically living off of him still while also running around like a teenager. It made me sick.\n\nI had no desire to be part of my mother's life. My father never pushed the issue early on and he never spoke bad of her. He always told us kids that we were adults and could make our own choice to have her in our lives. I chose to not speak to my mother our acknowledge her in any way for 4 years. It was the best 4 years of my life.\n\nHowever, my father soon guilted me into having a relationship with her because he felt bad for her. I've been back in contact for 3 years and I'm miserable. She calls me daily, is constantly trying to do things with me, shows up where I am uninvited and unannounced, and generally is a pain in my ass.\n\nSo your kid's are all old enough to make decisions concerning their relationship with their mother. Keep being pro-choice about their relationship with her. Do not force them to do anything- this us something they have to figure out in their own. They will be okay.\n\nAnd for the love of all that is holy, please do not let this woman wear you down on your decision to cut her out of your life. No matter what she says or does. I see my father suffer greatly from losing my mother and still loving her, trying to help her, and getting shit on in return. It breaks my heart because he deserved so much more than what she did to him.\n\nBest of luck and much love, support, and wishes of strength to you and your family. ", "Hi, I'm really sorry you've all been put through this. My mother had an affair and left my young brother, father and I when I was 12 going on 13 (after my dad found out and asked her to, with us kids besides him, crying and in shock) and I have never felt the same about her since. The anger I felt for years has subsided with the help of counselling (just last year, at 33. It wasn't really a thing when I was a kid - I can't even remember one adult asking me if I was okay) but that loving bond just isn't there and never will be, no matter how much she tries to push it on us now we're adults with children of our own. I have very little respect for her and she's gone on to make bad decision after bad decision in life. My mother has taught me what not to do in life, so I thank her for that at least, but I'll never love her in the way a daughter could. It's a huge shame for everyone, and I'm so sorry this has happened to your family. You sound like a wonderful, supportive father and I'm sure you'll be a big help to your children emotionally, as they will you. Best of luck.", "I signed up for a Reddit account so I could give you some insight.\n\nI'm 28 years old - when I was 16 years old, I found photos of my father and my mother's best friend... you know, naked photos of them together.\n\nIt ruined my life. Straight up, I'm forever changed. It was over a decade ago and I still can't forgive my father, no matter how much my mother has been trying to get me to reconnect with him. And she tries, trust me.\n\nI honestly don't know if your kids will ever forgive their mother - for me, I can't forgive my dad. I just can't. I've tried - I still try and have a relationship with him, but it's very difficult. By cheating on my mother, he betrayed my brother and I, too. He betrayed our family. It destroyed my mother - and no matter what my parents problems were, she never deserved that.\n\nHe was very understanding of this for a long time, but now he just thinks I should \"grow up\". I will never have a relationship with him the way him or my mother wants me to.\n\nThat being said, if your kids can't reconcile with their mother - well, it's not necessarily the worst thing in the world. It's really sad, of course, but sometimes we just... can't. It's life. It's sad, but it's life.\n\nAll you can do is keep encouraging it - but if they don't want to, don't try and force it. What you need to focus on is being there for them - supporting them, encouraging them and should they want to open up to you about how they feel about their mother - allow them to.

I couldn't deal with anybody,  didn't want to explain what happened or explain why I didn't want to keep the baby.  Didn't want anyone else's opinion influencing mine.  Found a private agency,  went through profiles of almost 200 families before I found one I fell in love with.  And that was it.  \n\nIt was hard,  a lot harder than it had to be if I had reached out to someone.  I'm glad you have one close friend you opened up to,  but don't let your coworkers or anyone else make you feel isolated. If you don't want people to know the truth,  go with the surrogate story or whatever you're most comfortable with,  but don't hide and don't stop interacting with people.  It'll make the whole situation even harder. \n\nOn a side note,  I had a semi closed adoption.  Any communication is done through the adoption agency.  The parents don't have my info and I don't have theirs,  but every 6 months I get pictures of him  and I'll continue to get pictures until he's 18.

I found my birth family a few years ago, though my birth mother had already passed by that time.  So I have some small inkling of what it's like to have a situation where you're sort of saddled with having two mothers and two fathers.\n\nThe first thing that popped out at me was when you said this about Hannah's husband...\n\n> and does not even have any blood-relation to me.\n\nThis isn't completely true.  You may not have his blood coursing through your body, and he may not have your blood coursing through his... but your blood IS related and connected:  through your two younger siblings.  Your blood and his flow in those small bodies.  And recognizing that may help you with feeling more comfortable with him.\n\nAs for the rest - my advice is to take things slowly.  You do NOT have to decide what sort of \"relationship\" you have with anyone.  You can take your time.  You can just glide along for a while and sit with the knowledge until you're ready to make a decision... or until a dynamic organically develops between you.\n\nAnd as strange as this sounds... nothing has fundamentally changed save the fact that you now possess more knowledge than you did.  Hannah has **always** been your birth mother.  Your mom & dad have **always** been your grandparents.  Your siblings have **always** been your aunts/uncles.  You simply didn't know it... but the FACT of it has always been true.  By the same token, Hannah has also **always** been your sister.  Your siblings have **always** been your siblings.  And your mom & dad have **always** been your mom & dad.  None of that has actually changed because those are the roles they have each steadfastly performed in your life for the last 17 years.\n\nSo give it all some time to sink in... and absolutely give yourself plenty of time to grieve the death of your mom.  I honestly think Hannah should have waited a bit longer to tell you, if only so you had plenty of time to grieve the loss of the only mom you've ever known... but the cat's out of the bag now, so that can't be undone.  But you have every right to say you need time to figure out how you feel about all of this... and you absolutely have every right to take however much time you need to grieve.\n\nYou'll be in my thoughts... <3", "You don't have to come to terms with this overnight.  You can just take your time.  I think seeing a family counsellor (perhaps one specialised in blended and non-traditional families) might help.\n\nThe most important thing is that you have A LOT of good people in your life who love you very much, regardless of biological specifics.", "Just a side note to the main... if the step-dad, your biological Mom's new husband is a decent guy, cut him some slack. He's in as awkward a position as can be... while you've had it really rough, it takes a lot to step up and try to be a father figure.\n\nIt may not feel like he \"belongs\" at the moment, but if he's trying, don't fight it unless there's a truly legit' reason to do so.", "I was adopted and found my birthmom when I was 35.  My adoptive mom died when I was 21, and even though my adoptive dad and siblings were all supportive of my search, I had to grapple with feelings of whether I was being disloyal to my dead mom by seeking my birthmom and then having a relationship with her.\n\nWhat I worked out for myself is that I have two moms.  Sometimes people try to designate one of them as my \"real\" mom, but they are both my real moms.  One gave birth to me and gave me my genetic identity, and one raised me and shaped my life experiences.  I love them both, in different ways.\n\nI think you'll have an easier time of things if you don't think of Hannah as replacing the woman you knew as your mom whom you are grieving.  She is every bit your mom as Hannah is.  Just take your time absorbing and integrating all this new information.  In time, you will sort out your relationships with Hannah and her family.  And you will always hold your mom that died in your heart.\n\nYou could eventually learn to think of it like I do, that you're just lucky because you got to have two moms."], "edited": true, "body": ["year", "grow", "famili", "sibl", "sister", "brother", "brother", "sister", "sister", "realiz", "rest", "youngest", "year", "older", "older", "biggest", "sibl", "figur", "accid", "unplan", "parent", "have", "kid", "sister", "come", "complet", "unplan", "youngest", "felt", "distant", "rest", "felt", "spoil", "time", "treat", "expect", "treat", "youngest", "nurtur", "center", "attent", "like", "respect", "prioriti", "sibl", "thing", "cute", "precious", "want", "argument", "oldest", "sister", "hannah", "take", "care", "best", "mother", "figur", "know", "actual", "mother", "spend", "time", "brother", "sister", "take", "care", "best", "parent", "older", "felt", "distant", "sibl", "say", "hannah", "way", "mother", "figur", "mother", "lack", "father", "pass", "away", "probabl", "worst", "life", "young", "year", "cri", "week", "go", "crazi", "throw", "fit", "peopl", "react", "poor", "negat", "know", "sibl", "go", "period", "consid", "go", "emot", "despit", "constant", "recent", "thing", "happen", "hard", "harder", "sick", "long", "time", "slowli", "get", "wors", "lose", "parent", "older", "readi", "hannah", "tell", "truth", "brace", "tell", "shock", "know", "recov", "mother", "pass", "week", "pass", "felt", "time", "wait", "come", "truth", "say", "want", "tell", "final", "stupid", "kid", "unprotect", "get", "pregnant", "child", "time", "parent", "want", "babi", "away", "adopt", "unshak", "want", "child", "complet", "refus", "away", "eventu", "agre", "rais", "household", "parent", "guardian", "grow", "think", "real", "parent", "appar", "older", "sibl", "know", "mention", "fact", "aunt", "uncl", "mother", "hannah", "swear", "tell", "sick", "hannah", "approach", "plead", "reliev", "burden", "want", "tell", "mother", "agre", "tell", "time", "pass", "death", "want", "mother", "grandmoth", "hannah", "say", "life", "want", "tell", "swear", "time", "felt", "like", "tell", "hold", "final", "glad", "abl", "tell", "truth", "want", "take", "complet", "idea", "react", "strang", "mysteri", "kind", "see", "mother", "light", "actual", "mother", "level", "relianc", "nurtur", "matern", "relationship", "fratern", "hannah", "tell", "know", "final", "mother", "open", "know", "feel", "lose", "mother", "fact", "real", "hannah", "give", "custodi", "year", "turn", "hannah", "hannah", "marri", "children", "fact", "girl", "husband", "guess", "step", "idea", "respond", "say", "final", "chanc", "rais", "mean", "tell", "refer", "feel", "natur", "readi", "call", "hannah", "glad", "tell", "truth", "blame", "hide", "long", "fault", "glad", "know", "go", "speak", "nephew", "niec", "realiti", "half", "brother", "half", "sister", "hannah", "explain", "realiti", "understand", "best", "kind", "shock", "near", "hug", "kiss", "cri", "ask", "cri", "say", "know", "tell", "half", "brother", "half", "sister", "relat", "move", "know", "certain", "closer", "present", "forc", "live", "speak", "hannah", "husband", "shake", "hand", "tell", "proud", "give", "tell", "want", "main", "life", "come", "need", "tell", "tri", "place", "father", "figur", "know", "accept", "father", "happen", "husband", "biolog", "mother", "blood", "relat", "older", "hannah", "weird", "parent", "hannah", "prepar", "actual", "thing", "mother", "sit", "famili", "couch", "tell", "readi", "famili", "want", "hug", "long", "imagin", "felt", "like", "final", "get", "forc", "hide", "long", "say", "glad", "keep", "bear", "absolut", "confid", "right", "choic", "ask", "quiet", "say", "understand", "heavi", "come", "grip", "like", "husband", "identifi", "need", "present", "revel", "tell", "like", "speak", "privat", "go", "hous", "tell", "know", "heavi", "want", "leav", "understand", "want", "continu", "relationship", "understand", "know", "mother", "love", "feel", "like", "home", "hug", "hold", "tear", "buri", "face", "chest", "tear", "hold", "head", "hush", "tell", "okay", "say", "final", "real", "home", "afraid", "afraid", "know", "belong", "fear", "apprehens", "lose", "mother", "know", "know", "accept", "second", "feel", "right", "like", "say", "thing", "final", "correct", "person", "wish", "know", "truth", "earlier", "felt", "stronger", "connect", "sibl", "biolog", "mother", "chang", "real", "mother", "accept", "accept", "home", "call", "accept", "famili", "know", "real", "mother", "mean", "mayb", "see", "thing", "mean", "mayb", "devast", "distraught", "death", "mother", "will", "mantl", "piec", "mother", "hannah", "lessen", "blow", "lose", "mother", "tell", "biolog", "mother", "equal", "real", "mother", "definit", "want", "role", "real", "mother", "year", "leav", "adult", "effect", "guardian", "parent"], "id": "2dva7x"}, {"comments": ["Sorry for your loss.\n\nWhat exactly did you do to confront your wife?

It's about a total breakdown in communication between you and your wife.\n\nYou disagree on what to do about your daughter's education.  Instead of working it out together and presenting a united front to your daughter, the both of you have been pulling her in different directions and trying to assert parental dominance over your co-parent.  Kicking your daughter out was your wife's latest show of strength.  Your language- paraphrased, \"a breach of my authority\"- demonstrates this is also how you perceive it.  You're locked in an authoritarian struggle with your wife because you don't agree with each other, and for whatever reason you don't have the skills as a couple to talk it out.\n\nWhat your wife did to your daughter is completely unacceptable, and you're understandably angry about that.  My guess is that your wife is likewise frustrated by your apparent deafness to her concerns about your daughter's future.

If you are financially comfortable, I can't understand why your daughter came home after one semester of trying something she had no aptitude for.  Colleges usually don't ask you to leave unless you haven't done well for a year. \nCollege isn't technical school, it's in part for students to experience different subjects and see what they might like/be good at.  Surely she had general education requirements that she could fulfill? internships and jobs she could try?\n\nThere's no harm in trying something you aren't that good at, but there sure is hell a problem with giving up entirely if you don't succeed at the first thing. \n\nWhat your wife did was wrong, wrong, wrong. But is it possible that she has tried to push your daughter to work harder and you have taken the other path of letting the daughter \"find herself\" without any real pushing?\n\nYou can divorce your wife and that might solve one problem, but you still need to think about whether you are cultivating a spirit of independence in your daughter. Nothing in your post suggests that your daughter is able to handle difficulties herself. She went to college for something YOU are good at--maybe because she liked it, but maybe also because she knew it would please you.

Sometimes a person can be *all* of those things. \n\n A man builds and relies on his inner strength, to stand on his own against the faults and weakness of others. He creates a place for himself; small enough and solid enough to maintain on his own, to shelter him against the chaos of others. That is his place, and that is where a man is hard. That is where he draws the line, it is what he defends at all cost, it is where he chooses to listen or to ignore, and one day, it is what he might choose to share with someone else. \n\n This is not always a physical place, though it can be- it is a place you create inside you, for you and only you. *Children* live in the spaces of others, *men* make that space for themselves. \n\n Now there will come a time, when you have built your space, and the world outside is cold and brutal. And you will want to shut yourself in and keep everybody out, because it hurts so goddamn bad to be outside. But you listen to me when I tell you that shutting yourself away, that turning off yourself and your emotions will only make things worse. \n\n *You* are the warmth in your own world. When it's cold, that is the most important time to show that warmth to others. In turn, over time, they will share their warmth with you. Look for that warmth. Cherish it. Choose your friends carefully. Build ties with people who show you care and concern, drop ties with those who are too wrapped up in themselves to give back. Be the kind of person you would want to be friends with, and your good friends will always resonate with you. \n\nBe hard, but not cold. \n\n You seem like a great kid. Smart. Thoughtful. Aren't a lot of 'em who bring out the old man in me. Maybe when you're my age, you'll tell someone the same thing. \n\n You're gonna be fine. You got this, no matter what.

There are three options I can think of.  One, if you have relatives in the area, maybe you could live with them and complete your school.  Two, if you have a really good friend, you could talk to their parents, and see if they could take you in as a foster child.  Either option would work, and both options could register you as a foster child to help with food/clothes/etc so you shouldn't worry about it harming them for helping you.  \n\nThe other option, and this is from personal experience.

Right now. Not three years ago, right now. Why? Because her relationship is over, and so she wants yours to be over too, so you can both be miserable together. \n\nNow think about her breakup. He didn't just break up with her: he left the country. He didn't just leave the country: he disappeared. You are currently holed up in a hotel room, hiding from her. He moved away, to hide from her. Why is no one calling this person on her shit? Why are the people most in need of therapy the ones most resistant to going? \n\nIn your situation, I would do this: tell your parents, matter-of-factly, what happened. Tell them you don't feel comfortable returning to their home until their draw a harder line with forcing her to seek some kind of counseling. If she did this to you, she did things that are much worse to her ex-boyfriend, and stands to do even more horrible things to your parents. They need to act now. She may be an adult, but she behaves like an adult with a profound personality disorder. She may never admit this, but with a little luck she might find a counselor who can help her contain it. \n\nYour boyfriend is a separate issue. This happened three years ago, and it doesn't seem like he ever had any plans to tell you. This second part is far more problematic. So the question is: do you think you can ever trust him again? Be honest with yourself here. I do think it's possible to recover from cheating, but it's a double-whammy when it also involves a mentally disturbed sister. So the discussion becomes: what, if anything, can he do to earn your trust again? If you know deep down that answer is nothing, then you have to begin the miserable task of moving on. \n\nAnd it is a miserable task. Heartbreak on this level is the worst. You might consider seeking counseling or a support group, not because there's anything wrong with you, but because you are having totally reasonable reactions to being betrayed on this level. For me, I find that sometimes the greatest gift a counselor gives is telling you, \"yes, that was awful. Go ahead and be in pain.\" With a support group, you get that plus the companionship of people suffering similar hurt. They will get it in a way few others will, regardless of whether your decision is to fight for the relationship or let it go. ", "Your sister lashes out at other people when she's feeling upset and vulnerable. I'm seeing a pattern: she fights or breaks up with her usual emotional-regulator/enabler/punching bag, she is crying and upset, she looks for you (or you are accustomed to going to comfort her), she sees a reminder that someone loves you (in a way she doesn't feel loved or lovable, probably?), and she takes that person away from you. She did it when she came to Jake's looking for you. She did it when she told you -- twice, to make sure you heard -- that she'd slept with him. \n\nYou are enormously justified to be feeling everything you're feeling. It's okay to be lost right now. It's okay to be reeling. Your life has been bound up in these two people for so long, and it's hard to know who you are when this has happened. But you're the same person you always are. You have always deserved stable, good, giving, loyal love from the people around you. What they did has nothing to do with you -- you were just there when Sara needed a victim. And you were just there when Jake was going through whatever made him cheat, which, again, had nothing to do with you, because you can't control someone's choice to cheat or not, just like nothing you could do could deserve cheating.\n\nI am so sorry, but your sister is dealing with some serious, malicious psychological patterns (undiagnosed personality disorder, maybe? She sounds a lot like my mom, who has borderline, or her mother, who had narcissistic personality disorder, but obviously I can't diagnose -- I just think a book like Stop Walking on Eggshells could be useful for YOU, being on the receiving end of this behavior). She is ill. She will not get better on her own, and nothing you can do will make her better, either. She needs to choose treatment, and she needs to make that choice freely, and you can't even persuade her to do it. And if she seeks treatment, she won't get better for years. Maybe in the future, way way way down the road, she can be a sister to you again. But right now, she is dangerous. She always has been. And she's made you shoulder the burden of keeping her emotions in check, but the thing about that is -- it's emotional abuse. And physical, in your case. She was making you responsible for her choice to abuse or not abuse you and your family, but then regardless of what you said or did, she would find some excuse to blow up if she wanted to. It was an illusion of control and of responsibility, including moral responsibility, which you're feeling right now. But I promise you, hand to my heart here, that Sara is not as fragile as she has made you believe. She's not as fragile as SHE believes. She's got something called \"learned helplessness,\" but she's not actually helpless. She is in control of her own behavior. And she needs to accept that control.\n\nTalk to your parents, if they will validate your feelings and not tell you what to do. Find your own therapist. (Therapy is the best way to overcome familial abuse like this -- my mom and I have had a very similar dynamic to Sara and you, and it took a long time for me to feel good about being my own person outside that dynamic). \n\nWhat happens with Jake is up to you and Jake. Some couples can get over cheating, with honesty and counseling. Some can't, or don't want to. Somehow, he's going to have to earn back your trust, if he wants another shot. And he'd fucking better be good to you right now. But find other people to lean on. Do you have other friends? Do you have a trusted mentor or religious leader or something? \n\nDo what is right for you. Don't stay stuck with someone you can't trust. Don't stay just because other people can't handle their own feelings, the consequences of their betraying you. The healing process, if there is to be one, has to be about YOU. Not Jake's guilt. Not Sara's dramatic extremes of emotion. You will figure out what's right for you, at your own pace, and you'll work this out at the right time. It's going to be okay.

Not always, but it is a nagging though that comes in every once in a while.  I'm guessing it is the same in your state, but in our state, we had to file an affadavit listing the reasons that we needed emergency custody.

He abused your children. I know it must be unimaginably hard to feel like you're keeping them away from their mother, but in truth you are protecting them from their abuser. It's the only thing you can do: love them, protect them, use all the resources you can to find professional help for your family.\n\n", "You have done everything 100% right.

But I promise you, in the long run this is so, so much better for their wellbeing and development. You have removed them from an extremely abusive home - and even if he didn't hit them (yet) witnessing their mom being harmed *is* causing emotional harm to them. Being in a home where that is going on is so damaging, and you have done the right thing. You are doing the right thing. \n\nAnd everything you've offered mom regarding contact is great. That's exactly what I would've advised - neutral spaces or your house and no boyfriend. Or, contact being supervised by a trustworthy adult (I.e you). \n\nHonestly, if she isn't even willing/able to try one of the more than reasonable contact options you've offered, that is a sign she still isn't able to prioritise the children over her shithead boyfriend and yeah, maybe for now she shouldn't be having contact at all. If this is how things are, I'd worry about any unsupervised contact in case Asshole decided to drop by. \n\nThe sad reality is, you can't do anything more to help her. It really sucks, and I feel so bad for her, but you can't make her leave him. If her not seeing her kids wasn't enough of a motivating factor to seek support and find a safe exit from that relationship, I don't know what would be. Give it time, she may still be working up the courage. \n\nAs for how to handle this with your kids, please remember that *you* did not create this situation. *You* aren't stopping them from seeing their mom -Asshole is. This will be very hard for them to understand and they have experienced a trauma as well; perhaps you could seek a child therapist or social worker to help them and you talk about it? The general rules are to give them space to talk about their feelings, validate them, be loving and reassuring but also be honest (in a way which fits their understanding). It's often surprising how much kids understand about the problems of adults in their lives. \n\nAnd - you don't say their ages, but if they're old enough to have phones or some degree of private computer access, please make sure mom and Asshole aren't continuing their manipulation through those means. \n\nTo summarise: this sucks, but you're doing great and doing everything right, keep being kind and open with your kids, seek a professional to help them understand what they experienced and what's happening now, and to advise you on how to talk to them about it. \n\nGood luck. You're a great parent. \n\nEdit: and make sure their school knows mom and/or Asshole are not, under any circumstances, allowed to collect them.

I'd send her a letter or an email letting her know this and then let her come to you when she's ready.  She might need a few days, or a few weeks, or even a few months.  But always let her know you love and support both her AND her partner.\n\nIf you want to talk to parents who are going through the same thing, check out PFLAG (http://community.pflag.org/).  I am not sure if they have meetings in your area, but you might find support from someone who can relate to what your feeling in terms of almost missing out on your daughter's life.  I'm sure your daughter would appreciate the effort.\n\nAnd one last thing:  do not out her to anyone.  She will come out to who she feels comfortable with.  That is her choice, and sometimes family members can turn ugly or even abusive when they know.  \n\nAnd from my perspective, I can say that I wish I had a parent like you.  One that looks on me proudly and would have no trouble accepting who I ended up loving.  One that accepted me and was glad to know about my life, even the weird \"gay\" stuff.  One that would defend me to the bigots in our family, and not look at me with misery and sadness every time we met in person.  In the end, we all just want to be loved and made to feel like we matter.

I was very academically inclined but shy whereas my little brother was an athletic social butterfly who got B's and C's.  My parents owned their own business and worked 364 days a year and only had Christmas Day off--so they were incredibly hands off when it came to helping us with school.\n\nI had instances where my dad would tell me to 'help' my brother by writing his essays for him, or he would take my old work and give it to him. Obviously, my brother would use it.\n\nI felt hurt too, like you did, but conflicted because here he was, riding off of my 'success,' if you can even call it that. But I also worried that my brother's marks would be too low without my help, and would just get lower. On top of that, my parents weren't rich and worked so hard--I felt guilty by saying no.\n\nSo I continued this way for a few years, thinking that I was just helping him to buy time and he would then be smart and catch up on his own. I couldn't stop either because I was worried that if I didn't help, he would be streamed out of high school classes that would gear him towards university. In that case, he wouldn't be able to choose if he wanted to go because that choice would be already made for him.\n\nYou know what happened? Obviously, he didn't work harder to help himself.\n\nI still remember reaching one of my breaking points one night. I had taken a computer science course in grade 10 where the final project was to create a little restaurant ordering program that would calculate the order total and ask if you wanted extras, that kind of thing. I remember the teacher had a list of bonus tasks you could do for extra credit, like including computer graphics in certain places and whatnot. I did all of them and had one of the most complicated programs to hand in. We were given a lot of time in class towards the end of the semester to finish this.  Of course, two years later, my brother also took the same class and had the same assignment.\n\nOne evening, my brother asked me for help. I asked him when it was due and he said it was due the next day. I was steaming mad, because he had spent the whole evening playing video games and was only asking me for help at midnight. He hadn't even started! On top of that, I KNEW he had been given many chances to work on it in class, so it's not like the teacher didn't give him enough time to work on it.\n\nIt was at that moment that I realized that I HAD to say no to him. He had played video games all evening, not because the assignment was too hard, but because he knew that big sis would bail him out with a flawless assignment that he could just tweak to make his own. All that time I had helped him because I was worried he would do poorly otherwise only taught him to become lazy and expect others to bail him out--the very same thing that I thought I was helping him avoid!\n\nYes, by saying no I was making things more difficult at first, but what I learned is that **you must help him learn to fail when he is young because the stakes are lower and he can learn from his mistakes without jeopardizing his future. The longer you 'help' him, the higher the stakes get and the more you will feel forced to help him, otherwise he will fail completely and not get in to post secondary school, or graduate from university, etc.**\n\nMy dad also tried to guilt trip me to do it for my brother. When I said no, my dad said \"if you won't do it for him, then do it for *me.*\". That was tough but you HAVE to stick to your guns because you are only crippling your brother if you continue.\n\nYour brother is only 14 now, so I would tell your parents why they absolutely cannot enable his behaviour any longer. Soon, he will be looking at post secondary institutions, and it's not cheap to fail out then--which is exactly the path they have put him on.\n\nIf your parents still refuse after you speak to them and insist you continue, then I suggest that you not bring home any assignments and/or keep it from your parents. Cut them off at the source.\n\nThere is a good chance they will guilt you by saying that they are 'family' and that \"this is what families do\" and \"don't you love your brother and want him to succeed?\" You might get a \"we just need you to help a little longer.\" Take it from me--if they won't stop, then you need to practice some tough love and be strong. I know it's not something a smart 16 year old should have to put up with.\n\nI suggest you don't tell your parents that you feel hurt that you aren't getting recognition while your brother does nothing and gets awards. This argument will fall on deaf ears as they may likely suggest that you are just being selfish. I highly suggest you talk to your parents and focus on the negative consequences this will have on your brother. Even better if you can come up with concrete examples how little bro has just gotten further behind, or lazier, etc.\n\nGood luck!

I talked about it with our ombudsman and she gave me some EXCELLENT advice. \n\nLook up nonviolent conflict resolution. It\u2019s basically a three step strategy where you, in her words, \u201ctake the person along with you on your emotional journey\u201d so you can come to a place of understanding. I recommend starting with your SO.\n\nFirst you recount exactly what was said, and take any and all potentially judgmental or value-holding words out. Then you confirm with them that your memory is accurate, and let them know how it made you feel and why. Finally, give them the floor to respond, or ask them to stop the behavior. The basic structure is \u201cYou said  X, correct? Well, when you said X, it really made me feel Y because of my Z experience. I want to know what you\u2019re thinking OR What you said was really hurtful, even if you didn\u2019t intend for it to be, and I really need you to stop and think before you\u2019re tempted to speak like that in the future.\u201d \n\nIn my case, a coworker was super pissed and complained multiple times that her future in-laws took her and her fianc\u00e9 out to dinner and paid with a visa gift card (she was embarrassed about how \u201ccheap\u201d they were). When I was in college, there were weeks when I ran out of food and money on Wednesday and didn\u2019t get paid til Friday so I just didn\u2019t eat those days. I would\u2019ve appreciated any food during those broke and hungry weeks - how it was paid for wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. So my ombudsman recommended the following script for the next time she bitches: \u201cIf I understand correctly, you felt embarrassed when your in-laws paid for dinner with a gift card, because you\u2019d prefer they pay entirely with cash or a credit card? To be honest, I have a hard time not feeling offended by comments like that because I\u2019ve gone hungry before and would\u2019ve been thankful for any food, no matter how it was paid for. I\u2019ve used visa gift cards without any shame in the past, and now I feel like you\u2019re judging and shaming me as well. Why do you feel that way? I want to know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n\nShe actually recommended calling out my coworker in front of others in this way, as showing vulnerability has a lot of power and other coworkers might share my feelings and have had similar experiences, so they might feel empowered to speak up in the future if they see someone else do it.

All of them have reached out to me with weak apologies full of justifications.

No mature, responsible adult should attempt to outsource damage control for their own poor behavior. \n\n**Not that it matters, from Sammy's perspective:** Each and every single one of your family members who was bad-mouthing your girlfriend owes her an apology. However, it's going to be extremely awkward for Sammy to have to accept them, and it also puts her in an unpleasant situation. If she forgives and begins to spend time with them again, she's going to feel like a doormat and will privately obsess over how much they might be faking it when they're nice to her. If she doesn't forgive them and keeps her distance, she may feel like a jerk for doing so. \n\nOption A is going to be awkward and uncomfortable for her at best, but at least she won't deprive you of your family. Option B is far more comfortable for her, but it also means that you're probably not going to see much of them either, and she'll be indirectly responsible for that.\n\n**Like I said: There's no truly clean resolution here.** On top of all the nasty gossiping they did, your family has really put Sammy in an awful situation.\n\nLong-term, this could play out in several very different ways depending on stuff that's hard to predict now. Over the short-term, if your family doesn't offer heartfelt apologies (or even if they do), I think it's best for you and Sammy to ghost them for a bit. If they do reach out, respond with polite indifference to any queries. Deflect questions. Be cordial but chilly. Keep your distance and respond with succinct, impersonal statements when necessary, and shut down conversations quickly:\n\n - \"(Sister), I think it's best if you make other arrangements for babysitting at present.\" Don't offer justifications or rationalizations for this. You don't owe her any.\n - \"No, (brother), this is not going to impact your job.\" Do not say anything to his co-workers. That would drag uninvolved parties into Sammy's humiliation and your family's dirty laundry, and you don't need to do it anyway to leave your brother uneasy about having shit-talked the person who got him his job.\n - \"Hi Mom and Dad. Thanks for the invitation, but we'll be spending Thanksgiving and Christmas on our own this year.\" Again, you owe them no explanation.\n\nAnd so on. If your family was at least somewhat close before all this went down, they're likely to get increasingly unnerved by this. Good! Actions have consequences. The responsibility for mending the damage is on their end, not yours.\n\nWhether any of them takes the next logical step and offers a full apology ... well, that's up in the air.

I used to work in the legal field, so here are some suggestions for things you should talk about with your lawyer ASAP:\n\n1. I'm getting the sense that you're a SAHM. If that's true, ask your attorney to file a motion for interim financial support. Basically, this would require Mark to continue paying certain household expenses while the divorce is pending.\n2. Although Mark has said he will relinquish custody, you might want to ask your lawyer to file a motion for interim custody just to be safe. This will establish the custody arrangement for while the divorce is pending. Keep in mind that Mark will have legal rights as a parent to the twins until a court sets up an alternate arrangement.\n3. If you have joint assets (bank accounts, house, cars, etc.) ask your attorney about ways to keep Mark from running away with them if he decides to play dirty. She can file motions to prevent this from happening. Have her do the same thing for any accounts you have in the twins' names as well.\n\n\nOther things: \n\n1. Put the twins in counseling, the sooner the better. They are going to be sad, angry, and confused, and they need a safe space to discuss that. Your pediatrician can probably recommend someone. \n2. Find yourself a safe space, too, be it counseling, a good friend, your church, etc. You are going to need a place to talk these things out also. \n3. Try to keep the twins' lives as normal as possible. They should still go to school and activities, visit family and friends, have the same bedtime routine, etc. At this age kids are terrified of change, and you need to help them understand that their entire lives aren't going to change. \n\nI'm sorry, OP. THere's nothing about this that doesn't suck, is there? Take good care of yourself. \n", "Damn. That's amazingly rough. And I don't think there's any easy fix. But you are in NO WAY at fault in any of this.\n\nYour husband can't control what he feels, but he could have talked to you much, much sooner about this. If he had come to you about these feelings months ago--years ago!--you could've gone to a counselor, discussed how to address them, or done any number of things to try to resolve the issue. The fact that he didn't tell you the truth until he had already decided to break for it was the coward's way out. Not only once he'd signed a lease on the new apartment, but right before going on a business trip, so that you can't even talk to him about it! It's appalling behavior.\n\nBut he's shown that he's that kind of person, and how set he is in being that kind of person. You can't change that. And you're right that your children are too young to hear the reasons why their father left him.\n\nGet a lawyer of your own; your husband says now that he wants to give you a good deal, but you CANNOT count on that holding true once the legal machinery starts grinding. Your lawyer can give you advice on how to talk to your children, and/or point you towards a therapist who can help you with that. There are probably support groups for newly single mothers out there, too.\n\nYou should tell your family the truth about what your husband said, if you're on good terms with them.

I strongly advice against just ignoring what she said about your father and continuing life as normal. You don't have to have a relationship with her, you can just finish out school and then move out when you're 18 or move in with your father now.

She let her selfishness destroy your family. It is good to move past your hatred of her though. Don't worry too much about feeling your anger in the short term, but it's bad to hold onto it. That's a consuming, toxic emotion that's hard to contain to the people that deserve it if you let it fester long enough. Talking to a mental health professional is probably a good idea going forward.

Nobody can say anything that will help make this situation any easier on you. I don't have any personal experience with a family member but I can tell you this;\nAs a respiratory therapist, it is my job to remove patients family members from life support. When the family is ready, the RT will enter the room. You have the choice to stay, or leave the room. Many patients leave as the pulling of the tube can be something you do not want to see. As soon as the tube is pulled, many people enter the room and hold their loved ones as they pass on.

It took me a very long time to establish boundaries for situations like this; don't make the mistakes I did, and let your good intentions run you ragged. You owe nothing to anyone. \n\nMaking baked goods is a lot of goddamned work. It takes experience, practice, patience, love, time, and money to make beautiful product, much more than anyone outside of the industry probably understands. \n\nIt's easy to ask a \"baking person\" to donate their product. *It's just a cake, right? That's not too many cookies, you can do those real quick. I'll pick them up tomorrow, see you then.* No ma'am. You're not asking me for a handful of cookies or a cake, you're asking me to invest in materials, then apply all of my experience and skill, towards producing a finished product. Just because you can breeze in with the demand and pick it up real quick doesn't mean I can snap my fingers and make it at the drop of a hat.\n \nI love my friends, I love my family, but they are subject to the same scheduling constraints and pricing schedule as everybody else because they have all, without exception, worn out their welcome with requests for donations and discounts and tutorials and even ridiculous crap like demanding that I appear to decorate cakes and cookies live as part of the entertainment portion of a charity dinner. No thanks, toots, you're going to need to get your dancing monkey routine from someone else. \n\nI donate regularly to charitable causes of my own volition. When someone asks me to donate something outside of those causes, if I believe in the cause or support the effort, I do so happily. Know what I donate? Cash. That's the point, right? To raise money? Here's some money. Pander elsewhere, run along now. \n\nYour aunt needs a reality check. You can say \"no\" anytime you see fit. If you have a few bucks laying around, you can donate them if you want in lieu of donating product, but don't feel obligated- I sure as shit would refrain from doing so after she showed her ass in such spectacular fashion, but that's just me.  \n\nWew. Sorry for the rant. Felt good though. ", "\"No\" is a complete sentence. Absolutely do not do anything she's asking - it will only encourage her to be this crazy in future.\n\nIf I were you, I'd post a brief explanation ONCE online where she's bitching and then refuse to engage further. E.g.\n\n\"Aunt, I'm sorry you felt that the 400 cookies Jules asked me to make for her family event belonged to you. Jules, you should know, specifically arranged her request in advance, paid for the ingredients, and compensated me for my time.

He doesn't give any more reason than that, doesn't go into greater depth or explain his feelings. Instead, he chooses more cowardly \"solutions\" like hiding your products and removing them from your packing. \n\nHe's exhibiting controlling behaviors.

He is a predator, and predators don't make a move until they're sure they can do it without getting in trouble. \n  \nI 100% guarantee you that this man is going to escalate his behavior.

That doesn't mean you have to passively accept his actions at all. \n\nThe next time you see one little thing from him, call him out on it loudly and immediately. \"What are you looking at? Stop staring at my sister's butt.\" \"Get your hand off her. Back off. She obviously doesn't like it.\" Your sister should speak up as well. Both of you should be loud and unafraid of creating a scene. \n\nOf course he will deny, excuse, or minimize his behavior. Repeat that you don't like it, loudly.

Now is your chance to make up for that in a big way. Stand up for your sister. \n\nAnd please don't call yourselves bratty teenagers.

", "Sounds like your Mum would prefer to think that her boyfriend's behaviour around your sister is due to your sister's clothing and behaviour, instead of being forced to acknowledge the fact that her boyfriend is a creepy pervert. Which is shitty, especially as she knows that her daughter is being made to feel uncomfortable in her own home, and instead of trying to make that better, she's been making it worse by policing your sister's clothes and essentially suggesting that your sister has brought creepy BF's attentions on herself. \n\nI think moving out is the best bet for your sis, but in the meantime she should make it clear to creepy BF that his attentions are unwanted. If he puts his arm round her, she should move away and tell him 'I don't like that, please don't put your arm around me.' If she catches him staring at her, stare back and say 'What?' defiantly. If he does something again in front of you like checking out her butt and nodding at you or something (which is SO PERVERSE in many ways) then you should also speak up and say 'what? Man, that's gross, what is your problem?' Let him know that his creeping is not going unnoticed. He probably has himself thinking he's getting away with it because no one's addressed it with him. Bringing it into the open in front of everyone and calling him out is more likely to bring the whole situation to a point at which your Mum either kicks him out or your sister decides to leave. \n\nShe should never be left alone with him, especially not completely alone in the house with him EVER. ", "Dear OP\n\n1. Yes, show your sister this post. For telling your father without her permission: You did what you felt you needed to to get resources and advice on protecting her. While this is more insidious, it's morally the same as reporting it when you see a stranger hit their child. You don't need the child's permission.\n\n2. Keep believing and supporting your sister, and in reaffirming that this shit is fucked up.\n\n3. That you want to stay living at home because it's \"comfy\" shows remarkable self-awareness, but also suggests you aren't learning the life skills necessary to be a good partner/housemate to others in life. See countless /r/relationships posts whining about SOs who think the Magical Chore Fairy will take care of everything. This is independent of the current problem and not what you were asking advice on, but worth considering.\n\n3. Your sister is being sexually harassed in her living situation, which is in turn triggering inappropriately controlling behavior on her as well. This is an escalatingly abusive situation. You are her primary confidant and support in dealing with it. ...and you just told her that being comfortable is more important than getting her into a safe situation. You're still earning high marks in the Protective Brother role, but that was a major deduction. Yes, her circus, her monkeys, but dude, empathy!\n\n4. Your dad is talking big, but fails to realize this situation is already serious enough to merit an intervention. Your sister is being actively harassed right now, with your mother's implicit consent through her enabling.\n\nDear OP's Sister: I was you once upon a time. You get your own list. \n\n1. Move out. Move out, move out, move out. Move to your dad's to a friends, in with a roommate, on your own, out with your brother. However you can possible pull it off, move out.\n\n2. Don't let politeness interfere with solid boundaries. Mom's boyfriend is abusing family dynamics to get away with his harassment. Firmly and loudly call out every boundary overstep, every time. \"Please don't touch me.\" \"Don't sit so close.\" \"Please leave me alone.\" \"I find your interest in me disturbing.\" He'll probably try to gaslight and deny he meant anything inappropriate. Ignore it, and keep calling it out. Take physical action to stop his behavior (move away, remove his hand, block him from putting his arm on your shoulder). I took the \"wear bulky clothes to remove access my body from him\" tactic with limited success. (Note: I now operate in a bra-free household where I frequently wander around starkers.) Refuse to be left alone with him -- demand chaperones. \n\n3. Your mother is in denial. That doesn't mean she loves you any less. Depending on her particular parenting style, you can try explaining to her  that\"corrections\" are putting the blame on you instead of on the pervert who would be sick enough to have sexual feelings for his daughter-figure. Assuming she's not that rational about this any more, be more visceral: \"Ew, it'd be gross if anyone in this house got hard while thinking of me!\" \"Fuck bras, no one in this house should be ogling my tits anyway.\" (And a bra to sleep in?! WHY THE FUCK SHOULD MR. CREEPY EVER SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING?!)\n\n4. Once you move out, refuse to see him. Your mom can visit you at coffee shops, or send him \"out\" while you come visit for a family dinner. Your mom might try to say that you're being ridiculous or irrational. Shut that down with, \"I don't care. He makes me uncomfortable, and you taught me to not allow anyone to do that to me. You can see him, you can see me, but you won't see us both at the same time.\" (My mother spent about five years doing \"split\" holidays with me and my harasser before she woke up and kicked him out.)\n\n5. Do not allow this bullshit to dull your instincts. This particular form of harassment paired with enabling is insidious in that it breaks down your natural boundaries and makes it easier for future intimate partners to take advantage of you. This is sexual harassment, this is not acceptable, and you aren't wrong for being upset about it. If you're in school, you might have access to a free or cheap counsellor to talk to. If not, you might have free help lines in your region you can call into.\n\n6. Speak out to friends and extended family about what's happending and get their support. You didn't ask for this, you didn't do anything to cause this, and you have nothing to be ashamed of. Your mother will probably be pissed or embarrassed, but that's on her for enabling Mr. Creepy. If you can't deal with it, give your bother permission to reach out on your behalf. The purpose is to establish a narrative (so your mom hears from more people how fucked up this is), to get support (emotional, financial, living options), and to take back control (your body, your story, fuck him). He needs your silence to make this work. Rip it from him.\n\n7. That your brother also sees this and can validate how you're feeling is such a huge advantage. Use it when someone tries to gaslight you. \"No, it's real, it's inappropriate, and OP sees it, too.\"\n\n8. This is #YesAllWomen moment, an upsetting Rite of Passage of being creeped on by a dude in a position of power. How you deal with this will give you skills to deal with it every single time it comes up again for the rest of your life. You're strong, and you're aware that this shit is fucked up. Fight it.\n\nGood luck. ", "Your mother is supposed to protect and care for her daughter. That's literally what a parent does. Instead, she is insecure and ignores the HUGE predatory signs this guy is showing. You should run a thorough background check on the bf. Not saying he will have anything on there, and not saying that he is a child predator, but it sounds like a possibility. Never let your sister be alone with him.

As far as your wife goes, you need to turn that ultimatum around on her. You weren't the one having an inappropriate relationship. She was. There is no doubt that you and your wife need to work on your relationship. She's the one who caused this by having an affair with the BF and it's on her to fix it, not you. She is no position to be issuing ultimatums. You are. She also needs to work on her relationship with the daughter as well because it sounds more like she is upset at the daughter for calling her out about the BF. Do not let your wife gaslight you, OP.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. \n\n\nI typed the above statements out after reading about the library incident - then I went on to read that he **THREATENED TO KILL YOU**. \n\nPLEASE, OP, buy & read \"The Gift of Fear.\" You are in an abusive relationship. \n\nMy ex-boyfriend used to say stuff like that to me. Then, one day we were hanging out getting ready to hop in the shower. He turned to me and said, in a light tone, \"You know, I could kill you if I wanted to.\" I thought he was joking and I said cheekily, \"Yeah, but you never would.\" He then, with NO WARNING, grabbed me and put me in a (real, not play-wrestling) chokehold and held me there as I resisted/squirmed/kicked/clawed and tried to get a breath of air, until my resistance finally knocked both of us over and his roommate ran down the stairs to figure out what the commotion was. **THIS COULD BE YOU.**\n\nDon't put yourself in the position of being abused. Your boyfriend is legitimately unhinged (paranoid, jealous, confrontational, violent, emotionally abusive) and if you don't leave, this will escalate, I can ABSOLUTELY guarantee you.\n\nThe most dangerous time in an abusive relationship is when the victim leaves. The next second you get a chance to be alone, start packing a \"go\" bag. All your important docs, some clothes, toiletries, etc. If you can't leave that same day, hide it somewhere he can never find it (a friend's house, if possible). DO NOT allow him to know you are leaving. Reach out to friends/family and tell them about this, but don't leave any trace in your phone of the conversations. Pick a set date (not \"soon\" or \"eventually\" - like, \"next Wednesday\" or \"This Saturday at 3 PM\") for when you're going to leave. Have someone come pick you up, and take your go bag with you. Anything you leave behind should be something you are okay with getting trashed/destroyed.

After 4.5 years, he should be able to separate you from his ex and trust you.\n\nAnd on top of that, I can't think of a good excuse for him saying that he'd \"freak out and kill you\" if you didn't have sex for two weeks. \n\nI know you love him, but he sounds imbalanced. If you were my friend, I'd be begging you to break up with him and come stay with me. At minimum, I think you should put wedding plans on hold until he seeks counseling.
