He did all of this before I got home from work. There are people who will think of your sister as an intrusion into their idealized version of a life with you.

We are as solid as I guess anyone thinks they are before something like this blindsides them. I am in total and complete shock, I'm just sitting here shaking I can't even cry yet.\n\nDale is at work right now, I haven't texted him or called him or anything at this point. When we got together he had just broken up with his college sweetheart. She was his first love. I was afraid I was rebound, he said that wasn't true I believed him, rest is history. Sorry is this is rushed and all over the place, nothing makes sense in my head right now.\n\nI used his laptop about 2 hours ago to open his contacts list he has saved on there so I could get addresses for our wedding invites. Been telling him to get those to me for over a week so I decided to do it. He keeps his contacts info on his email. When I opened his email, I saw an email on the very top of his inbox with the the subject line \"Re: Jen (not real name), how can I when...\"\n\nThe subject line got cut off after that so I couldn't see more without clicking. \"Jen\" is the name of his ex from college. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to decide if I should open it or not. I decided he should have nothing to hide so I did it.\n\nRest of the subject line was \"Re: Jen, how can I when you still exist?\"\n\nThe email was her replying to a string of emails between the two of them that has gone on for over a week. Long story short, Dale is still in love with Jen. He thinks about her constantly, he'll never find another woman like her.\n\nEven worse is that he makes fun of me and she laughs about it. One email she asks him why I don't make him happy and isn't he satisfied with me? I can't remember word for word, and I don't feel like reading it again, but he said something like \"she tries. She's just not good though, way too vanilla. I love her but the only way I can get off is when I think about f**king you and how wet you'd get. I think every inch of my bed was soaked from your pussy I have the biggest hard on just thinking about it.\" And then she answered with a bunch of \"lol\"s and said she felt sorry for the \"poor girl\". Another thing he said was that he made fun of me for having a large scar across my chest, onto my left breast, which has disfigured the nipple a bit. He said it looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands. \n\nThat is almost too much to bear, he might as well have punched me in the gut. I was in an awful car accident when I was a teenager. I had a big piece of dashboard shatter and basically fly into my chest. I almost died. I've never been ashamed of the scar. It's like a constant reminder that I survived something a lot of people don't and I should be grateful to be alive. The slight disfigurement of the nipple doesn't bother me either, I've always had the attitude of \"if someone doesn't want me because of a nipple, f**k them.\"\n\nBut to hear him make fun of something he knows is a result of something so major in my life (my friend was thrown from the backseat and lost her life) is just... I have no words.\n\nThe emails go on. Some are explicit, one she describe how she just masturbated while thinking about how he used to go down on her for hours. I'm assuming that these emails are just a small portion of their contact. The first email in the thread was Dale talking about how he doesn't think he can marry me and that he thinks about leaving me almost constantly. He said if she lived in this state he'd already have left me. It didn't sound like the first time they'd reconnected so I'm guessing if I snooped I'd find texts too. I don't need to snoop further. I've seen all I need to.\n\nObviously I'm not going to stay. Despite what he said about me, I'm pretty great and I know this. He said he misses \"backdoor\". Apparently I'm too vanilla to give it to him. Thing is, I've tried to initiate that as I enjoy it and he told me he wasn't into that. So he lied. Just to cast me in bad light.\n\nI'm so f**king mad I just want to throw his shit into a pile and light it on fire. But I won't. Because I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt me.\n\nI'm not sure why I posted here. It's too fresh to talk to my friends and family. Should I just pack my stuff and leave with no explanation? Just ghost? I've got too much dignity to scream and cry in front of him. I don't know what to do.

Like just open the tap and you'll get a pretty good listener, and someone who can be counted on to really try to be helpful and empathetic.\n\nBecause I am so reliably this, and because I do this right off the bat, regardless of how  \\*I'm\\* treated, two things often happen:\n\n1. a certain type of person realizes that this is a service I provide that they don't have to do anything more than activate. Consciously or un-, they realize I do this \\*regardless of what I'm given\\* so they realize they don't have to use energy to be reciprocal with me.\n2. I do this automatically and without ever evaluating if the other person has earned this level of attention and care.\n\nNow, part of why I did this is because who wants relationships to be transactional?? And if I am a generous person, doesn't it require me to live my own values regardless of what I'm given?\n\nWell, I've started to realize that there has to be some middle ground. It doesn't have to be transactional, and I am going to continue to be a generous person who wants to provide a lot of deep attention and care...but  I need to make sure I'm not burning up that energy on people who can't help me renew it by returning some attention and care back to me.\n\nOk that's a lot about me, I'm sorry, but I just see in your description of what you've now realized if this might be a mechanism at work with this person and in your life. And if so, I've realized a by-product of this dynamic is that this kind of person, in addition to not feeling a need to reciprocate, per the above, also never feels the need to, for lack of a better word, do anything to earn my friendship.\n\nSo I could see this kind of person seeing their invitations as currency to spend to increase intimacy or impress someone they want to cultivate a relationship with but since you're already on board with providing hot and cold running care and attention, she doesn't need to \"spend\" an invitation on you.\n\nSomething I've had to do with some of these relationships is just re-frame them.

I looked it up on my phone and found out they had been engaged for two weeks. I still sucked it up and congratulated him. I was very upset, but kept it to myself because I didn't want to ruin the happy time for him. He talked to me about the wedding and how it was going to be very small, in her home state. Only immediate family. I joked I was disappointed that I wouldn't get to see him get married (years earlier he had told me I would be a \"groomsman\" when/if he ever did), but that I understood why they would want to keep it small. Months later, they get married. I see pictures on different websites and his sister and mothers FB pages. There were well over 100 people present at that wedding. Standing up next to him was his college roommate (obviously not an immediate family member) and my heart broke. Then, it hit me: our friendship had been one-sided for years and I didn't even notice or cared to notice. When it was his birthday, I would call and wish him a happy birthday. On my birthday, I wouldn't hear from him or I would hear but he would make no mention that it was my birthday. Not finding out about his engagement and not being invited to his wedding opened my eyes. After that, I stopped making an effort and he seemed to notice and stopped making one in return. About 2.5 years ago, he emailed me saying he didn't know where the friendship went but would I help him with a new TV project he was working on. I used the excuse that I was too pregnant (I was) to give it 100% of my time. He didn't congratulate me or anything. That sealed the deal for me. \n\nMy advice to you is to ask your friend whats up. My guess is that this friendship is one sided like mine was, but either way, you'll have some  closure to the friendship. Don't wait years to get that closure because it will eat away at you.", "\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s been on my mind and I\u2019ve just got to ask: You\u2019ve delivered all of your wedding invitations and I didn\u2019t get one and why is that?\u201d", "have you asked her? An invitation could have gotten lost in the mail."], "edited": true, "id": "bctq5b", "body": "One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together.\n\nIt's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable.\n\nA year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see.\n\nEver since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out.\n\nThe wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry.\n\nI feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not.\n\nThe trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return.\n\nNow when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself.\n\nI'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her.\n\nI've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend.\n\nI've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed.\n\nI do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world.\n\nBut I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then?\n\nEdit 1: Just to clarify things that have been asked a lot or requested to be put in an edit - 1) She hand delivered the invites to other people at work so I know it hasn't been lost in the post 2) I haven't asked her about it because I'm a total doormat and scared of difficult conversations and 3) I invited her to my wedding, but that was years ago so it's possible she thinks things have changed since then.\n\nEdit 2: This has got a lot more attention than I expected, and my first ever gold from a kind stranger, thank you!\n\nI have read every single comment, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me advice. You have given me A LOT to think about.\n\nOpinion seems to be divided over whether or not I should confront the wedding invitation issue or just let it go. I am definitely going to make sure that it isn't a mistake, but as for getting an explanation why she didn't invite me I'm undecided. I'm going to have a think about that and the best way to proceed, but your thoughts have all been really helpful.\n\nIn terms of our friendship in general, I'm not going to be too hasty to write it off. I'm going to try and put my feelings aside and see if I'm right about it being one-sided. If it is then I will have learned a good life lesson, and if I see it as worth saving then I'll have to deal with that the best way I can.\n\nIt does seem the bigger issue here is my non-confrontational approach to my relationships. Some of your comments were hard to read but only because I know you're right and this is something I have to change. I've withdrawn from friendships before because they've hurt me and I've felt unable to say anything, and that's not really fair.\n\nIt's a general problem I have with uncomfortable conversations. Whenever I have to have them I basically descend into a panic, my mouth goes dry, I shake and I can't find the right words to say. If it's a bad enough problem that I can't ask a good friend a simple question then I can't ignore it any more and I need to work on this. Thank you for pointing this out to me as a real problem, I'm going to find a way to get better at it.\n\nI will post an update of what happens, thank you again!\n\nTL;DR My best work friend didn't invite me to her wedding, and since then I've started to question our entire friendship. I think it's permanently damaged everything we had, and I'm feeling really hurt, lost, and unsure of how to proceed."}, {"comments": ["Do a Mariah: \"I don't know them.\"\n\nYou wouldn't be lying, you only share genetic material with these people, that's about it.

And OP, so sorry for your loss.", "This is actually something I can contribute to, and I hope I can be helpful. At 34, I'm older than either your daughter or her BF, but I have some experience in this. Three years ago, my girlfriend died after 15 months fighting leukaemia. I already got on really well with her family, but we became really close during the whole ordeal. My then-girlfriend and I both lived in the UK (having met here), but are/were both Canadian, and her family still lived there. When she was diagnosed, they both spent as much time over here as they could, and at the end basically lived here full-time. My late-GF and I were long-distance, and I would usually come up on alternating weeks, again more often near the end. We all lived at my girlfriend's flat, and that, plus the reality of the situation, brought us all together.\n\nIt was no surprise when she passed, as we'd all known it was coming for a few months. But that didn't lessen the effect. Her parents stuck around for a few weeks after, until the memorial was done, then had to go back to Canada.\n\nSince then, her mother and I have kept in touch, and I periodically speak with her father and routinely post things back and forth on Facebook with her brother. He mother has outright told me, as well a shown me, that she considers me a son-in-law in everything but name. I'm part of their family and they're part of mine.\n\nYour daughter's boyfriend is in a very fucked up place. His world is turned around and being 20 years old will only magnify that and the importance of everything. The reality is that he will eventually meet someone else, and he will love again; he's 20, of course he will. But there is no chance that he can see that. So, if I could give you a recommendation, I would say that you just need to be there for him. Think of him like the son of your best friend. Someone you know, and care for, but don't see every day. Let him know that you're there for a shoulder to cry on or for a drink. Commiserate and share stories of your daughter and the great times they had together and you did with her. You will both have memories and talking about them can help you both remember the happy times.\n\nI wouldn't push for things like therapy, meeting new friends or \"don't worry, you're young, you'll be OK/love again\" etc. If you feel comfortable helping him find somewhere else to live, or putting him up on your couch for a few weeks, that might not be a bad idea, but don't push it too hard. When you're that age, \"I have nothing left\" is an easy place to go to. Just be there and give him a sense of normalcy and regular life when you can, but don't back away from what happened. Let him know that you guys share a tragedy-when my late GF died, I felt guilty for awhile because I felt like I was imposing on her parents' grief and tragedy-they had known her for 32 years, we'd only been dating for 3.5. But they acknowledged and recognised my pain, and they validated that it was serious and real and deserving. We shared the loss together, spoke openly about both the loss and the love we had for her. And that made it a lot easier to get through.\n\nFeel free to PM me at any point if you want, I'm happy to share more or go over specifics.

But considering you don't know him well, I doubt there is much you can personally do for him except continue to be pleasant with him when you happen to see him, and try to keep in touch and talk to him if he is willing. If you know how to contact his parents, or if you know any of your daughter's close friends who might also be close with him, the best thing you can do is to inform them of the sentiments he expressed to you and that you are worried about his mental health and ask them to keep an eye on him and check in with him to make sure he is safe.", "First, I'm very sorry for your loss.

The area it's in is popular so I wasn't really worried about not finding someone to room with.\n\nBecause of the above and that I was there first, I took the bigger room naturally. When showing potential roommates (including Lana) round, I was sure to show the smaller room and say \"this would be *your* room\".\n\nWe moved in 8 months ago, and it's been happy families. Never heard Lana complain about her room. Because I have about 6x the wardrobe space that she does, I told her she's welcome to store her off season clothes in there, or whatever she wants to store, as long as she's not popping in every morning to get dressed. She was happy with this.\n\nJust over a month ago, I went travelling. Now I'm not the biggest fan of having people in my room, but I told Lana if she had someone stay (her sister, friends from home) they could sleep in my bed. She said thanks, and as she's been such a great roommate and rarely has guests except her boyfriend, I didn't worry at all.\n\nI came back yesterday. I was exhausted from the flight and travelling, and just wanted to shower and sleep. As I walked in Lana was in the living room with her boyfriend. We said hello and hugged, had a very quick catch up, blah blah. Then I dragged my suitcase to my room, opened the door and found it full of stuff that was not mine. I kind of yelled \"what the fuck?\" and briefly thought I was so jetlagged I was confused, but opened the door to Lana's room and saw all my stuff.\n\nI walked into the living room and asked Lana what was going on and she said \"Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, we put my stuff in your room just because it's bigger and you weren't here and you said I could use it.\" I was honestly so tired I could have passed out then, so I probably wasn't in the best state, and told her to move it all back immediately. She said they were in the middle of making dinner and I looked tired so I should have a sleep. Her boyfriend then said \"And anyway, you pay the same rent so isn't it fair that you both get the big room at some point.\" I was getting really frustrated and could feel tears welling up (hysterical from lack of sleep) so I just said \"We'll deal with this tomorrow, and it's getting moved back\" and then I went to sleep in *not* my room.\n\nI've woken up now and I'm so pissed off. Lana's at work so I can't talk to her but what should I do when she's home? I feel like this is going to turn into an argument, I don't think it'll be as simple as \"okay let's swap now you're home.\"\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I went travelling for a month and told my roommate she could use my room for guests if needed. While I was gone she swapped all our stuff and moved into my much bigger and better bedroom. Never had a problem with her before but she doesn't seem like she's planning on swapping back. What do I do when I speak to her after work?\n\nEDIT: I've taken the advice of most people on this thread and moved my stuff back. It's taken hours and I'm knackered but I think if I left it another night it would be a real problem. I sent her a text when I was almost done (incase she kicked up a shitstorm and came home) to say \"Hi Lana! Hope you're having a nice day at work. Just to let you know I'm moving my stuff back into my room, didn't want you coming home and walking into the wrong one! :)\" (Yes I'm petty.)\n\nI'll be talking to her when she gets in because this is out of character for her, to the point of it being *bizarre*. She's never been anything but a model roommate, so I'm gonna give her a chance before we're donezo. If she wants to be reasonable and have a chat about rent portions I'm happy to do that. She's never had a problem with the rent before, and honestly I've never had uneven rent amounts in any place I've ever lived (whether I had a bigger room or smaller room) but a lot of people here are saying it's the norm so I'm open to talking about it if she's not ridiculous.\n\nEDIT 2: Lana should be home in a bit. I'll update when I can.\n\n**EDIT 3: Hi everyone, I've got about a million messages asking for an update but last night was a bit mad and I'm still pretty jetlagged so sorry but I went to sleep. Anyway, here we go.**\n\n**So as you know, I text Lana to tell her I moved my stuff back. She didn't reply to me, fine whatever, but she didn't kick off so I figured we were okay. I told my Aunt what had happened, who was as baffled as all of you, and I told her it was probably all sorted, just keeping her in the loop. I also told my boyfriend, who works about 5 mins down the road. He offered to come round, incase Lana's boyfriend came round, but I told him not to because then we're ganging up on *Lana*. He insisted on going for a \"coffee\" with his mate a couple roads away incase we needed backup. Which is a bit ridiculous but very cute of him.**\n\n**So I did get myself a glass of wine while waiting for Lana, not because I was nervous I just like wine, and she came home. I was sat in the living room and gave her a very cold \"hi\" when she walked in. She sort of froze, bag in hand, and her eyes darted between me and my/not her/our bedroom door. She blurted \"did you do it!?\" and I said \"what, move the rooms back? Yeah of course.\" and her eyes went all wide and she dropped her bag and ran into the bathroom. I could hear her talking on the phone so I was like yipeeeee I guess Tom's coming round fuuuuuun!**\n\n**I  heard the door unlock and I was about to go full hulk on how psycho she is, when she came out of the door and stood between our bedrooms. Their doors are adjacent and she just stared between them both, breathing heavily? It was really odd. Then I noticed she was crying and getting a bit panicky, so I asked what was going on.**\n\n**She burst into tears and said \"Omg he's going to kill me\" and just sobbed so yeah it was the boyfriend's idea completely, as a lot of us suspected. She's honestly always been a perfect roommate, which is kind of why I came to this sub. If she was generally an arsehole, I would have known how to act, if you know what I mean? Anyway Lana has a bit of a breakdown, and it turns out POS Tom has always been a bit of a POS, very jealous (which I always saw hints of, but Lana never mentioned so I didn't), and has amped up his POSishness while I've been away. When I left he just finished school and basically moved in unannounced, and when she'd mention he hasn't been home in days, he'd give her the \"what, don't you love me, I treat you so well, you're so selfish, blah blah\" shit and refused to move. She showed me the texts he send her, absolutely horrific stuff, things like \"ring me in the next five minutes or we're over\" \"send me a picture of you at your desk with something showing todays date so I know you're at work\", just abusive stuff.**\n\n**ON TO THE ROOM: As we guessed, he moved it. He did it while she was at work, which is actually a bit gross thinking of him going through my stuff, and I'm considering somehow implying I have crabs or something he could catch just to make him squirm a bit, but I'll work on it. lana came home and said what are you doing, he made out it was just temporary and that I wouldn't mind (such a gentleman speaking on my behalf) and he would move it back, and he was doing ti for her and she was so selfish etc. When it got a few days before I came back, Lana suggested moving it back, and he completely denied he said that and told her it was her idea to move it and he only did what she told him but it's staying now or she'd be sorry.**\n\n**So basically Tom is a prick and Lana sobbed and apologised and cried and I fed her wine. She didn't want to see Tom (who obviously assumed he lived there now) so I text him from her phone saying our Landlady (my aunt) was coming round for an inspection and staying for dinner after with my family and he couldn't come over tonight. He sent a lot of begging, whiney texts, and then went on the offensive and called Lana a liar, so I rang my aunt, *explained everything* and had her write us a fake landlord email mentioning the visit and how she was looking forward to fajitas (because she's an absolute babe and I make good packet fajitas), which we forwarded on to Tom. He left her alone for the rest of the night, apart from a few texts.**\n\n**I'm not entirely sure what we do about Tom. Lana sounds like she wants to break up, judging from her crying and screaming\" I hate him, I hate him, I hate him\" into her wine. I think she's scared to though. I checked with her and he doesn't have a key, so that's a relief. I've told my aunt everything and she said she is happy to ban him from the flat, but Lana would need ot break up with him first and get all that sorted.**\n\n**Thanks everyone for the advice. I know it wasn't the most popcorny update, but hopefully Lana will be okay, and we're going to be doing some girly shit this week and avoiding Tom and yeah, god knows what will happen.**"}, {"comments": ["I will start by saying: For children to cut off a parent, that parent has to have done something that really, really upsetting, something so hurtful, so unforgivable.

Please don't judge before you've read the entire thing, I promise I'm not as awful as I sound in the title. \n\n\nI've been with Matthew for 3 years now, and we have a perfect relationship. I know everyone says that, but it really is true. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I've only met his family a few times because they live pretty far away and my boyfriend had a huge falling out with his father a couple of years ago. They've since patched things up, but it's still not the same as it was. Matthew is not particularly close to his sister because she's 12 years younger than him and he doesn't see her that often. Of course he still loves and adores her, but they're not a very close family. Jessica has cancer and as a result has lost all of her hair. Matthew was devastated, obviously, and has been going to visit her more often. I have only seen her a few times since, because of work commitments. I have been down twice alone (without Matthew) to visit her in hospital. She\u2019s a lovely young girl and I\u2019m devastated for her and their family.\n\n\nJessica is home at the moment and Matthew's mum called last Friday and asked if we could go over there. Upon arrival Matthew's mum whipped out a pair of scissors and shavers and said that the whole family was shaving their heads for Jessica. My job is modelling. I have very thick, natural auburn hair that reaches my waist. It's one of the reasons that I'm fairly successful. It's one of the reasons I can afford to pay the bills. I couldn\u2019t model without my hair. So I respectfully and politely declined, telling them that it would be detrimental to my career. I don\u2019t have two jobs, I don\u2019t have a back-up, this is my job. It\u2019s my money maker. If I couldn\u2019t model, I don\u2019t know what I would do. \n\n\nMatthew immediately got angry, insisting that this is more important, and while I agree that sentimentally and emotionally this is far more important, I cannot afford to lose my hair. I have to think logically about this otherwise I won\u2019t have a roof over my head. Matthew\u2019s mum was very upset, and proceeded to tell Jessica that I wouldn\u2019t shave my hair because I am vain. I apologised to Jessica and explained my reasoning, and I went home. I have barely spoken to Matthew since it happened as he says he \u2018needs space to consider if he wants to be in this relationship.\u2019 I told him that I would do anything other than shave my head. I'll do a charity run, I'll raise tons of money, whatever I can possibly do, instead of shaving my head, but he won't listen. All he says is 'how can you put your looks and vanity over my cancer ridden sister'.\n\n\nDid I do the wrong thing? \n\ntl;dr my career is modelling and part of my success is due to my hair. My boyfriends younger sister has cancer so the family shaved their heads in support of her. I declined, and now everyone hates me.\n\n\nedit: a few people have asked so I'll copy+paste this from one of my replies: Matthew told me that Jessica is very upset and has told all of their family repeatedly that she hates me for having long hair and refusing to shave it for her. She's only 13 years old though, I have a feeling that the family are perhaps poisoning her view and of course she's going to be having a difficult time as it is. I can't hold any grudges against a young girl being in such an awful situation.\n\n\nEdit 2: I'm completely overwhelmed by the support here, so thank you a lot. I have read every comment and most of them are very helpful and make me feel a lot better. I am going to give it another few days and then I am going to speak with Matthew and his mum and Jessica. I'll be sure to post an update soon. Thank you again. \n\n\n*Edit 3: gosh I hate threads with a ton of updates when there's no real update but I feel the need to defend Matthew's family a little. They're not crazy people. They've always been absolutely lovely and kind and welcoming towards me. They were a normal, happy family before this happened. Their youngest member of the family, the innocent, sweet, vulnerable girl is dying and there's nothing they can do about it other than try to make her happy. Of course their view is clouded, of course they're not being rational. Matthew's mum has quit her job to spend more time with Jessica, they've spent every penny they have on gifts for her. I don't think they're crazy or bad people. They're in a world of hell and the only thing that makes it better is putting a smile on Jessica's face and me shaving my head would have done that. If they don't come to terms with it and start thinking clearly soon, then I will agree with everyone and I will call them crazy and run for the hills, but at the moment, I'm trying to be as supportive as I can to my boyfriend and his family whose hearts are all broken.

Right now I'm going to go hug my kids because even with all the crap, I never would have had them without Mark in my life and they are my two favorite people in the world.\n\nThank you again.\n\n\nI hope this doesn't get too long, I'm sorry in advance, there are lots of emotions here. \n\nMark and I met in college and had a really great relationship. We dated until both of us finished law school after which he proposed and I gladly said yes. At the time he was much more religious than I was and he insisted we have kids right away and that I stay at home with them to raise them while he worked. I had really wanted to start my practice as well but I could see it was really important to him so I relented and we had two amazing kids and his law career really took off. I was able to work from home and hire help three times a week (with me still in the house) to do insurance and real estate paperwork reviews--it was something but I had really wanted to be a litigator. I was even ok with this and my resentment didn't ever really show unless Mark would remind me that stay at home moms should be stay at home moms and not work at all. \n\nMarriage turned really bad after our second child was born 8 years ago.  We basically became like unfriendly roommates. I pleaded with Mark to go to counseling with me and he would and things would get better for a few months then it would go to crap, I would insist on divorce but then he would remind me that our (his actually) religion does not allow divorce so I would insist on counseling--and the cycle repeated itself more times than I can count. \n\nThen about a year ago Mark hit me with the bombshell revelation that he has been gay since he was a teenager. I was honestly relieved for him because it seemed to explain so much of why he acted the way he did, why he was distant and over compensating with so much. I was actually very relieved that our divorce would finally come and he could live true to himself. \n\nHe moved out, but it turns out he had been having an affair with his much younger partner for about 5 years (the dates on this are VERY sketchy btw because it's very possible this \"man\" was underage when he and Mark started the affair--he certainly was when he and Mark met). I grew very resentful that I was busy working my fingers to the bone to save the marriage to appease Mark's religious sentiment while he was off having sex, technically cheating on me and violating the principles of the religion only he really cared about.  Our kids are also of the age that I could have easily gone back to work but again I stayed at home to appease his desire to appear as the perfect Christian couple--all the while he is carrying on with a younger lover. \n\nMark has also fought me at every turn over the divorce. He doesn't want to pay any alimony even though it would take me years to get my career to where I could support even half the lifestyle the kids and I lead now. He wants to pay bare bones child support and wants the image that we split custody but in reality he makes the effort to see the kids once every couple of months and ignores their calls. He's a great lawyer so even he has to know all he is doing is delaying the inevitable to make things hard on me. In all this time, he's taking sabbaticals from his firm and taking long vacations to places like Tavarua with his boyfriend delaying our divorce even further. \n\nIt happens almost daily, and certainly weekly where family and friends will see me at dinners, the grocery store or restaurants (we live in old farm community that has essentially been turned into a commuter town for the city near by but it retains a very small town feel) and tell me how amazing they thing Mark is for \"living true to himself\" and being so courageous to finally come out. I've gone along with this because I don't want to embarrass either of us. But yesterday I was approached by an older woman from our (old now-thank god) Church who almost \"shamed\" me for keeping Mark in a relationship that he didn't want to be in.  I didn't snap but its as close as I've come. The only people that really know how I feel are my best friend, my Mom and my counselor. \n\nIs it time that I just start telling the truth when I have one of these awkward interactions? I feel that if Mark had left me for a younger woman he'd been seeing for 5 years, everyone WOULD be expecting me to spill the beans on what a jerk he was. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: my husband came out as gay. He'd been having an affair for 5 years while we struggled to keep marriage together. He's now being awful in the divorce but our \"community\" wants me to play along and be supportive of his decision. \n\nEdit: this totally blew up as I was taking kids to school! Wow thank you everyone. Lots of people asking the same questions which I should have clarified in the beginning...sorry about that!\n\n1. I have a really great lawyer as of January and he's working on it. Mark did every shitty divorce trick in the book to frustrate me into settling. It took that long for me to be able to even hire a lawyer in our area. I'm lucky in that I could represent myself in preliminary hearings which in turn allowed a judge nullify quite a bit of the crappy stuff Mark has done legally. Now that I'm going through it first hand, I am absolutely going to go into divorce when I do finally work. I've always heard, but I'm appalled at how the dirty tricks can affect people's lives. \n\n2. I'm not out to ruin him...which is thus far why I haven't spread the talk of his affair. I don't think most people know that he cheated on me...and even if they do...they seem to be more impressed with his coming out. I rationalize that ruining him is not in my kids or my best interest. \n\n3. Lots of great tips and I really appreciate every comment...this was way bigger than I thought and I'm reading all of them.

We've chatted about movies, he once helped me with my language homework, and he's generally in the cafe hanging out most afternoons. Sometimes reading, sometimes working on his computer. He's also friends with the owners of the cafe and has always seemed like a nice person so I certainly wasn't against getting to know him better.\n\nWhen Sara gave me his number yesterday, she was selling him pretty hard.

I still had fun hanging out with him and I didn't feel unsafe or threatened until I got home.\n\nIn the 10 minutes it took for me to get into my apartment and get ready for bed, Derek sent me about 20 messages about how he wanted to kiss me and asking if he could come upstairs. I told him \"no, thank you for a fun evening. good night.\" and went to bed. My phone died overnight and when I woke up and plugged it in, he had sent me more messages confronting me about blocking his number, which I didn't do. These messages were over the top and intense and honestly, they worry me a bit.\n\nIt's obvious to me that I need to back away from this person, but right now I have no idea how to do that gracefully.

We talked a little more about this. she's a very open-minded person. Sara knows that Derek believes he sees and hears ghosts and said she wasn't sure if it was true but she didn't believe he was deranged. I probably misunderstood some of what he was telling me about seeing dead people because we weren't speaking English.\n\nShe asked me overall how I felt the date went and I told her that he was getting pretty intense, he's too old for me, and I'm feeling a little uncomfortable.

Despite his black phone case (mine is green), I didn't even notice and I looked at who had texted. It said \"Mom\". Okay, my mom texted me, I can ignore that until I'm actually awake. But under that was a Snapchat notification. A snap from someone named \"Roxy\". I was like who the f is Roxy and why is she snap chatting me? I opened it and bam- it's a picture of a pussy. And not the meowing kind with four legs and a tail. The caption said \"I want your tongue inside me again\".\n\nNow. I immediately thought it was a mistake. But I was alert now after being awoken by a vulva. I pretty quickly realized that this was my husband's phone. I felt like I was going to crap the bed and started to sweat. I looked at his contacts on snapchat and she has a yellow heart next to her name. I looked up wtf that means and it means they are \"best friends\". **WTF**.\n\nI feel like I'm going to be sick. I didn't do any other snooping because honestly, I know what I'll find. I just don't understand how he could do this. We're happy. I thought we were happy. We have sex *at least* four times a week.\n\nHere's the real kicker, Reddit. I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.\n\nHe's sitting in the recliner about 20 feet from me and I just can't find the words to confront him. How do I say what I need to say?? There is **no** way I am somehow overreacting or misreading this situation, is there? I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do.\n\n**tl;dr** Accidentally opened my husband's snapchat only to be greeted with a snap of some girl's vagina. I'm nearly 12 weeks pregnant and just can't wrap my head around this. Don't know how to handle this or confront him. \n\n**Update:** First and foremost, thank you all for your love and support. I feel it from here. Honestly, thank you- it's amazing to me that strangers care so much about my baby & me. Love back to all of you. So, husband knows something is up. I don't know if he saw that I opened a snapchat from Roxy and is afraid of what I saw and afraid to bring it up or if he's clueless and can just tell I'm upset about something. He's been asking me if I'm okay or if something is wrong about every hour. I told him my sister was having a hard time today (ironically, she just broke up with her boyfriend. Why? He cheated.) and I was going to go over to her place for dinner (I live in pacific time zone) and to spend the night with her. I'm here now. My sister is 20 and a whiz at the social media thing. She \"stalked\" his Facebook to see if this Roxy person popped up anywhere. She looked through his friend's friends. Bingo, we found her. Well, at least pretty sure. I didn't see her face in the snapchat. The screen was too full of her crotch. She's Facebook friends with my husband's good friend. She is listed as a receptionist at my husband's friend's law firm. My husband works a couple blocks from the law firm and he stops by often to grab lunch with his friend. That would explain how they met. Still formulating a plan on confrontation, trying to get as much information as possible first. My sister wants to burn his life to the ground, and honestly I do too, but I'm going to address this in the most adult way possible so that I can walk away from him with my head held high and be a deserving role model to my baby girl (not sure it's a girl, just a feeling). Good news? My uncle is a lawyer. Most of what he deals with are divorces. I've already contacted him and asked if we could discuss some potential legal issues (didn't specify what yet, feels like something I should do in person during our meeting).

He didn't want her to have the abortion and risk the transplant surgery and was hopeful that my situation might sort itself out without my sister's help. The chance was very small but it was there.

They tried working things out after the surgery, they went to counseling, they even tried to have another baby but they couldn't get themselves to do it.

I asked my mom if my sister still thinks that she did the right thing. She said \"she's not sure\".\n\nI can't stop feeling guilty. My sister saved my life but destroyed her own life doing it. She had to abort the baby she definitely loved and looked forward to and did that knowing that it will probably end her marriage as well. I was ready to go at that time.

The pictures were all old photos so I confronted him immediately expecting to hear something like \"Yeah, haha I forgot to delete that.\" which is cool. He denied being on tinder at all and my friend suggested that she make an account, set it to his specifications, and see if he turns up. and there's his profile.\n\nSo, this means that my boyfriend has been active on tinder within the past two weeks. I confronted him with this and he changed his story. Now he's saying that his friend has been using his account. He shows me his phone and says, \"Look, I have nothing to hide.\" and of course the app is deleted.\n\nSo I take his phone, download tinder, log in with his facebook and see that he has been active, albeit infrequently. There was one girl that he tried to meet up with back in May when I was out of town. The girl gave him her phone number and even though he deleted whatever messages they exchanged, I still saw that he had her saved in his contacts.\n\nSo that's about everything that I know. He either cheated on me or planned on cheating on me while I went out of town, and I'm sure this isn't the only time it's happened. This relationship is pretty much over.\n\nHe is swearing up and down that it's not true. He doesn't use tinder and he doesn't know this girl. I'm going crazy with how much he's outright lying. He seems so sincere, but I KNOW what I saw. I can't listen to him deny this one more time.\n\nI know that this is the end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to end it in a way that doesn't leave me second guessing myself. and moral support.\n\nTL;DR: Caught my boyfriend on tinder trying to meet up with girls while I was out of town. He's denying it so vehemently that I almost believe him. What do I do?\n\nEdit: This blew up while I was away!I'm sorry I won't be able to respond to every comment.\n\nSo I did some stuff that was kind of petty and stupid today: I made a fake tinder account, matched with my boyfriend, and he starts messaging me and immediately asks me to meet him for a drink. We agree to meet by a fountain in the center of my town and I pack up all of his stuff in a tote bag, put on a great outfit and went to the fountain.\n\nI stood kind of out of the way of the fountain in the shadows where I could watch the street that I knew he'd be arriving from. I was devastated, but I figured this way I could catch him without a doubt and end things quickly. All the time, he's messaging this girl on tinder.\n\nBut he didn't show up. Two of his roommates did. We didn't speak (I don't know them well), but they watched me for a while, figured out what was going on after a few more tinder messages, and left quickly.\n\nSo I wait a few minutes and I call my boyfriend and ask him where he's at. He says he's just gotten off of work and he's going to meet his roommate for a drink. I confront him with the fake tinder profile and he's dumbstruck and furious with his roommate, who he swears up and down is behind all of this.\n\nI'm at home now, just emotionally exhausted and confused. Whatever is going on with his roommates is super sketchy and creepy.\n\nadvice please?\n\nEdit part two:\n\nThank you all so much for your advice and support!\n\nA few things that I think are important\n\n* Up until this point my boyfriend and I had a great relationship. Really, no red flags anywhere. If I had already been suspicious that he was cheating this would be a much easier break for me\n* The most recent message on his tinder account when I checked it yesterday was sent to a girl he had matched with before we met. It said \"Would you want to meet up with my friend?\"\n* My boyfriend is the kind of person who's iphone passcode is 0000. I wouldn't be surprised if his roommates did know all of his passwords. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, his tinder account is still matched with my fake profile. To me, that indicates that he probably isn't the person operating the tinder profile. If it were him, wouldn't he have blocked the fake profile immediately?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of people have said that he probably sent his roommates to check things out for him. I can't write that off entirely but my gut says that it isn't true. I just don't think it's very likely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to his roommates, I'm very concerned that they have been using his profile to trick women into meeting with them. The fact that his profile hasn't been deleted makes me worry that my boyfriend is in on this. So that's about where I'm at right now. I'm worried that all of them are working together to at best, scam women, at worst, assault them and my boyfriend is at least passively involved.

I mentioned it once to my boyfriend (of 5 months), not because I expected him to do anything about it, I was just talking in general.\n\nMy sweetheart of a boyfriend remembered that and a few days ago he randomly handed me a box with an absolutely amazing makeup set in it. it retails for something like $300 and I almost didn't want to take it because it seemed like too much. But my boyfriend just seemed happy I liked it and convinced me to take it.\n\nI got to try it twice. The day I got it I tore into it as soon as I got home and tried some looks. I got to wear it one other time last weekend when I went on a date with the boyfriend and I got all dolled up for it. \n\nI intended to wear it last night for the same reason, but I went into the bathroom and opened the cabinet and my makeup set was gone! At first I immediately called my sister since we share the bathroom and I asked her where she put my makeup, but she told me she didn't touch it. \n\nAfter searching all over I still couldn't find it and asked my mom if she had seen a makeup set. She immediately told me she found one in my bathroom and took it \"back\" to hers. I asked her why she took my makeup set and she looked confused and told me it was hers.\n\nI tried to tell her \"No, it was mine, Brian bought it for me.\" But mom shook her head and said something like \"No 17 year old boy is buying something like that, it must be mine.\"\n\nI was getting upset and told her it was definitely, 100% mine and my boyfriend gave it to me,  but mom just told me that whether it was or wasn't doesn't matter because I don't need it.\n\nShe ignored me the rest of the night until she went to work. I tried going to get it myself but she left her door locked.\n\nFinally today after I woke up I went downstairs and almost lost it because I'm about 99% sure she was wearing some of my makeup, and I told her again I want it back. She told me to drop it and she doesn't want to hear about it again.\n\nI called my boyfriend to see if he had a receipt or something and he was *super* mad when I told him what happened, and he offered to come over and get it back, but I told him it wasn't a good idea to get in an argument now, so he is looking for a receipt to see if it helps.\n\nWhat do I do? I want my make up back! It's the first decent set I've had, and it was a gift from someone I love! I swear my mom knows I'm telling the truth but just isn't budging for some reason.

For our first few years together, she was a full time attorney working 50-60 hours per week.  At that time, her income was approximately 40% higher than mine.  The income disparity did not bother me at all (I mean, who doesn\u2019t like more money\u2026 hah!), but neither of us was happy about the amount of hours she had to spend at work.  When we met, she was already pretty burnt out and unhappy with the stressful job.  I tried my best to be supportive and encourage her to look for other jobs that would be less stressful.  She was open to it, but knew it would be a big pay cut.  She said she would rather stick it out for a while longer so we could pay off her student loans and save money for a new house.\n\nOnce the loans were gone and we had moved into our new home, she found a part-time (\\~15 hrs/wk) job working from home doing something more in line with her interests.  Her stress level went way down, and so did her income.  She still makes very good money, but her income is about a third of her previous job.  This is absolutely not a problem financially.  My income has steadily increased and she\u2019s still bringing in plenty.  We are doing great and have no money problems.  I have no regrets about any of it.\n\nThe thing is, every once in a while, she\u2019ll mention that she feels sad that she doesn\u2019t \u201ccontribute\u201d because her income is so much lower than mine.  I tell her this is absolutely not true.  Not only does she still have great income, but she contributes in so many other ways.  Since she has a very flexible work schedule, she is able to do most of the household chores, takes care of errands during the day, does a lot of the shopping, etc.  She basically keeps our household running.  But I think in her mind, the work she does for our household does not make up for the loss in income.\n\nShe recently found out we are eligible for health insurance through one of her attorney organization memberships.  She sent me the details, but it turned out that our current plan we have through my job is still a better deal.  I texted her and said I looked into it but we should stick with what we have.  When I got home from work, I could tell she was feeling down.  She told me she had gotten excited at the possibility that we could use something through her work and that she would be providing something major.  She was crushed when I told her we shouldn\u2019t use it.  I felt terrible\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sure part of the problem is that when we met, she was independent and doing very well on her own.  I think she now feels like she has become dependent on my income, and that makes her feel bad.  Also, she went from working 60 hours/week to around 15.  So she has much more extra time to enjoy life, but I think she feels guilty about it.  I\u2019ve told her many times that the money is not important to me, she contributes so much more than a paycheck, and I\u2019m much happier now that we can spend more time together.  I think she understands that, but she is still hard on herself about it.  She\u2019s not a money-grubbing person, but she has said she often thinks about all the money she has given up by quitting her high paying job and how much better off we would be financially if she stayed there.  But, luckily, she remembers how awful the work was and knows she does not want to go back to such a stressful job.\n\nI was wondering if anyone might have some advice on how I can make her feel better about her contributions to our relationship.  She knows that I\u2019m so much happier with our current situation, but she still has issues with it internally.  I don\u2019t know what else to do other than to keep telling her how much better things are now, even with less income.  If anyone has experienced this (on either side), I\u2019d love to hear how you dealt with it.\n\nThank you!\n\nTLDR: My wife\u2019s income decreased quite a bit.  While we are doing fine financially, she said she often feels sad that she doesn\u2019t contribute as much anymore and feels that she has become dependent on me.  I\u2019m looking for advice on how to convince her that she contributes more than her fair share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I wanted to say thank you so much for all of the replies! Also, there are a couple of questions I figured I\u2019d try to explain here:\n\nWhy did she cut her hours down so drastically (60/wk to 15/wk)? \n\nWhile she was working at her old job, we decided we wanted to start a family. The ideal situation was for her to get a low-hour, flexible, work-from-home job so she could be a stay at home mom with a little bit of income on the side. This job popped up and it seemed almost perfect for us. Unfortunately, the baby has not come as quickly as we had hoped (which we knew was a possibility). So we are kind of in limbo where she doesn\u2019t want to quit her current job or start a new full-time job because she could get pregnant at any time. \n\nCan she increase her hours from 15 to XX? \n\nWithout going into much detail, her job essentially gives her \u201ctasks\u201d each week. They vary in difficulty, but usually take her about 6-7 hours each. She normally gets two a week, but occasionally they have an extra for her. Unfortunately, her employer does not have enough tasks to steadily give her 3+ each week. So she\u2019s kind of maxed out where she\u2019s at. They are flexible in that she can request to only get one (or even zero for a short time) task a week."}, {"comments": ["Get your cousin involved. Go to the meeting.

When you go in there, there will be multiple people from the school, and you. Your situation is sad and seems to be well known. \"Backup\" will give you confidence and reduce the chance of you getting bullied and intimidated down from addressing the teacher's behavior.

Show some concern over the teachers methods and other students in school. Be approachable and reasonable to the school, even if teacher repeats what she says. Be the calm adult in the room. Principal might side with you to avoid conflict if you're the best in the room.\n\n- Describe yourself as legal guardian\n\n- Mention other parents have confirmed to you what happened. Schools listen to parents more than students. If the other parents are on your side use it, schools hate parents opinions being against them.\n\n- As your sister shouted you can apologise for that but only if they accept the teacher was unprofessional and action will be taken (if they get dickish about it). Stand your ground over how unprofessional the teacher was when treating a student. Express a teenager will have difficulties being personally attacked first that way esp mentioning your parents in such a way. A teacher in a childs care should know better. You'd expect those comments from a student, not a teacher. She failed in her duties and emotionally harmed a great student.\n\n- If your sister has done anything good for the school or has good grades mention them. Say this is out of character and it must have been provoked (teacher talking about your passed away parents in such a way and homophobic comments). Show concern over your sisters well being.\n\n\n- Check or even ask if they have any policy on LGBT students, bullying or all students being treated equally. Ask if they're willing to express this policy to prevent future incidents. It always good to come with a solution which will make you and your sister happy.\n\n- See what any LGBT support groups or national are like. Any advice, legal or how to deal with schools etc. [Stonewall](http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/initial_teacher_training/default.asp) UK has resources for schools on LGBT issues.

Your sister still needs to get her education. There are risks, maybe for second meeting if it escalates. \n\n- Ask your sister first, if she wants to go back into sports after x amount of time or wants to be removed from class or join another with different teacher. If school doesn't move teacher off coaching or class. Then at least get teacher to sign document saying she'll refrain from comments about your sisters personal life and will treat her fairly like any other student. Keep safe for any other incidents.

He had an 18 year old when he was 19 and was married to her mother for about 15 years.\n\nThey got divorced and we get his kids (15F, and 8M) for 2 weeks and then their mother gets them for 2 weeks. The 18 year old (let's call her Brittany) lives with her (45M) boyfriend. I've had a really great relationship with all 3 kids. Once brittany started dating her current boyfriend who is 45, the relationship between her and my husband really started going sour. I dont support her decision but her and I remained close and I did my best not to isolate her.\n\nAfter Brittany and I started growing closer she started taking more and more advantage of me and my kindness. Her boyfriend doesnt make much money and she doesnt have a job. Her sisters birthday is tomorrow and a couple of weeks ago she mentioned a nice coat her sister wanted and asked me if I would just go look with her.\n\nWe didnt have any luck at our local mall so I spent some time finding a nice coat on Amazon and asked Brittany if her sister would like it, she said yes and so I ordered it. \n\nWe dont get her sister on her actual birthday, but we are celebrating it today (1 day early). I had told brittany that the coat could be from the both of us, since I found it and paid for it but she did tell me the style/color her sister wanted.\n\nThen I get a text from Brittany saying that No, she wants to give it to her on her actual birthday and tell her mother she paid for it to prove that her and her boyfriend are successful. I told her I wasnt comfortable with that and I'm sorry but it's a group gift from us and for us, her birthday is today since she goes back to her mother's late tonight. I asked her to share her feelings and she said she is really angry at me and thinks I'm being selfish. I dont know how to respond to her. My husband currently has pneumonia which is why I'm turning to reddit and not him since he is really sick right now.\n\nI am new to being a step mom, and I'm really trying here. How do I respond to this? \n\nTldr: bought my 15F step daughter a present. My other step daughter wants to give it to her after she leaves our house and say she bought it.\n\nUPDATE: thank you so much for all of the advice! I truly am so grateful for all of it. Well last night my husband stayed home while I took my 15F stepdaughter and her little brother to dinner at her favorite restaraunt. I invited Brittany and she came with the 45M boyfriend. My 15F step daughter pulled me aside and asked if I invited him, I said no and she told me she really doesnt like him and if in the future we can ask him to not come. I told her I would have a conversation with her dad and her sister. After dinner we all came back to mine and my husbands home. It was pretty awkward, and when she opened the coat Brittany made sure to let her sister know that she picked it out and it was all her idea. I mostly just ignored it and enjoyed the birthday party. Later that night I went to drop off the kids with their mom. After the kids were inside their mom instantly said \"We need to have a conversation about Brittany's behavior.\" And I had a great conversation with their mother about everything, since her behavior is affecting both households and the kids. I talked to my husband and he is going to talk to Brittany, and we also talked about my role in her life and read him lots of the comments from all of you. Yes, the boyfriend thing is terrible, and my husband agrees that he is a predator. I know some comments mentioned the divorce, but overall, the two daughters have expressed the marriage was bad. Their mother had a long affair and it was all just a mess, I appreciate the comments talking about divorce and parenting, but we have all attended classes (me, husband, and ex wife) on co-parenting and we all try really hard to make these kids happy and have a healthy life.

Nobody will ever like you. You have no friends because of x thing.\u201d In a somewhat jokingly manner so that if I ever said he was being mean, he would say \u201coh, I\u2019m only joking, don\u2019t be so sensitive\u201d.\n\nFor a couple months now he started making fun of my appearance- \u201cyou have Dumbo ears\u201d, \u201cyour nose is like a skiing slope\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re as fat as a cow\u201d (I gained a little weight but nothing serious).

Sadly, Vanessa died in an accident 11 years ago when the kids were very young. I started dating Nick 8 years ago and we started off very slowly for obvious reasons. Nick has always been a little more distant than anyone I'd ever been with, but he and the kids lost Vanessa so young that I understood it. \n\nAfter 3 years of dating, Nick asked me to marry him and I moved in. I've always had a really great relationship with Luke and Lila and they were happy for me to marry their dad. I had wanted an actual wedding, nothing big, but Nick really didn't want one so we got married at the courthouse with just Luke and Lila present. We had a really fast engagement, but it worked for all of us. \n\nI have loved being Luke and Lila's stepmom and officially adopted them after I found out I was pregnant with our son \"Casey\" (2/M). The kids have been so great with Casey and help out so much. Nick was wonderful during the pregnancy and had always been a really loving dad and husband. \n\nBut Nick has been pulling away a lot the last few months. He's been even more distant than usual and working late nights and going away with friends almost every weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he's been impatient with both me and the kids. I found out I was pregnant in June and am now 21 weeks pregnant with a girl. The kids are excited to have a little sister, but Nick just seems so indifferent to everything and everyone. He's been missing soccer games, Lila's birthday, doctors appointments, etc. Casey is too young to notice, but Luke and Lila are so hurt by their dad's absence. These kids are so good and they lost their mom so young and I'm infuriated that Nick is ignoring the kids like this. \n\nLast week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives. We're going to have another child soon and before we know it Luke and Lila will be grown up and going to college. After an hour of arguing, he screamed at me that he wished Vanessa was still alive and that I had switched places with her and died instead. He also threw in some awful comments that I need to stop pretending I'm Luke and Lila's \"real\" mom and that I'm only half the mom Vanessa was.

He somewhat apologized this weekend and took all three kids to lunch, but he won't even look me in the eye. He seems like he wants to talk, but he doesn't say anything and I'm too upset to even be near him. \n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Honestly, I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back.

We've been together for eight months now and its the happiest I've ever been. Tom is a medical student, and we're both the first people in our families to make it to higher education. \n\nIn Tom's class there is a girl called Isabel. Tom told me she's top of the year and word is going around that she's a ''future world changer'' or something like that. They weren't close friends but she used to help him study sometimes, he says shes so smart that ''anyone would be an idiot to turn down her help''. \n\nAnyway I didn't meet her until me and Tom were grabbing some food and she came into the same place with her girl friends. The first thing I noticed about her was that she was absolutely gorgeous. Literally a solid 10. They started chatting and she asked who I was. Tom said (and thinking about this makes me smile) with a huge smile that I was his girlfriend, and Isabel's response was to say ''Thought you had better taste than that?''.

Tom wanted to say no but I didn't want to just leave her out there. \n\nWhen she got in she was absolutely drunk and high as possible. Giggling and laughing and reeking of weed. Her clothes were ruined from where she'd spilt her drink over them. I helped clean her up. I always bring a change of clothes when I stay away, but I gave them to her to make her more comfortable. Instead of saying thank you she tried to say how ''cheap'' my clothes were and how she wouldn't be seen dead dressed like that. I tried to tell her not to speak to me like that but she just made fun of my accent and how I speak. I put it down to the alcohol/drugs and didn't hold it against her. \n\nEver since then Tom started to distance himself from her. He still accepted her help with work but nothing else beyond that, and even that came to an end after she told him she'd only keep helping him if he went out with her. The final straw came not long after we came back for second year. Myself and Tom went out clubbing. Isabel and her friends were there. Tom got extremely drunk and was being sick in the toilets. He could barely stand up and was confused. One of Isabels friends came up to us and announced to him that she'd seen me kissing another guy while he was being sick. Tom got hugely emotional and wanted me to confirm/deny it. It took a lot for me to calm him down and convince him it was a lie, by which point Isabel had already ran over to ''comfort'' him. He realised it was her that made up the lie and shouted at her to leave us alone, and she started crying and went to the security accusing us of acting aggressively towards her, at which point we were both kicked out. \n\nEver since then she has left us alone. We spent Christmas with our families but were together for New Years. After watching the fireworks, we were snuggling in bed when Tom got an insta DM from Isabel. She sent him a few pictures of her with dyed hair and the words ''New Year, New Me.'' Let's just say those pics reveal much more than just her new hair colour. Tom was fuming.

But I love her so much, and she loves me, so it's seriously bothering me that I screwed up. She is the best wife a man could ask for. We've been married for 4 years. She gave birth to our second child a few months ago. As you would expect we've been quite emotionally attached to one another during her pregnancy and after she gave me our second son, but when I offended her a week ago she has sulked and ignored me as much as possible.\n\nI rush home from work like I have been doing, eager to see my wife and our sons, but now she says \"you're dinner's on the table\" and she leaves me alone to eat while playing with our son and holding the baby.

It's been devastating for her to abruptly change like this.\n\nSo here's the stupid thing I did. When we married she was very skinny/petite, it was just her natural body type (and she exercised a lot). Since having the first child she has steadily gained weight and become a little plump. Her body definitely has changed and she's not looking skinny and petite. But she's still just as beautiful and this has never been something I've seen in a negative light. But this was apparently devastating to her self-esteem, to an extent that I wouldn't have imagined. I've always told her when we're intimate or she's getting changed near me that she's so beautiful. In fact as she's gained some weight I've said it more and I can sometimes barely keep my hands off her when we're alone and she's changing or something. Yet she's always responded to this by saying \"she's gotten so fat\", \"I'm hideous\", \"I'm sure not what you signed up for am I\", and all that crap. One night I said the wrong thing (though I didn't know it would be when I said it): I kissed her thighs and said \"your curves have gotten so amazing\" and she just flipped out and started crying, saying \"so now you're just acknowledging how fat I've gotten out loud\" and she's been seeming sulky ever since.\n\nWhen I told her that she's not \"fat\", that she's just as beautiful as before and actually more so, she just gets more upset.

Most of it is related to my MIL allowing her ex husband to savagely beat my wife as a child and refusing to leave the realationship, even lying for her husband when my wife was finally old enough to tell someone. It only stopped when he abandoned the family for a younger woman and eventually died. \n\nDespite this my wife has saved her mother time and time again. MIL had a Brain tumor when we first got married and her husband at that time wanted to refuse treatment. We basically kidnapped her , took her to the best treatment center, paid thousands of dollars out of our pocket to ensure she got the best treatment and let her live with us for 6 months , my wife quitting her job to be her caretaker, getting her to rehab before moving her back home when she was well enough to be self sufficient. She was given a second chance by my wife. Her husband never visited in that 6 months.\n\nHow did she repay my wife? A few months later called her on her birthday and accused her of stealing $300. Keep in mind she had lived with us for 6 months, we took care of everything, including thousands of dollars in medical bills but her husband had become enraged over a check she had written to my wife when she offered to help with some bills ONE time. She actually threatened charges so my wife despondently hung up, I immediately wrote a check (it wasn't about the money) and a letter about how much she had hurt my wife and they only spoke rarely for the next 5 years.\n\nOne of those conversations was an intervention to ask her mother to please pay for a long term care policy as now that we had children we couldn't repeat the financial commitment we had made earlier. it was about $300 per month and we offered to pay half. Her mother is high maintenance and spends quite a bit on herself but refused to pay anything so we didn't do it.\n\nFast forward to 6 months ago, MIL had a serious fall and her terrible husband let her lie on the driveway for 3 hours because he didn't want to pay for an ambulance. He got his redneck kids to pick her up and take her to ER further injuring her. She was completely unable to walk for 4 months and now is barely able, has trouble dressing herself and going to the bathroom. \n\nOf course my wife saved her again because her husband had her in a terrible facility and she was calling my wife begging to be saved. We took her to a rehab place near us (we live 10 hours away from her home) her insurance paid for 90 days but the last 3 months we've been paying thousands out of pocket while hoping she can qualify for PACE. She doesn't qualify because she's still married and her husband has plenty of assets. He refuses to visit or help out with bills. Her only option is to divorce him and sue him to sell the assets to get herself some sort of cash or at least qualify for Medicaid. She's been kicked out of her current assisted living for refusing rehab and berating staff (she's racist) we simply can't afford to put her somewhere else so until she is divorced she's going to have to live with us.\n\nThis is a depressing reality and my wife has admitted she hates her mother, gets no joy from their realationship but feels responsible for her care. We have a two story home with our master on the bottom so we are having to make our kids share a room and sleep in a small guest room upstairs for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis would be easier to swallow if MIL was grateful or helpful in anyway. She's bossy, entitled, horrible to our children, and just a weird petty person.

Unfortunately, it is the weekend that my finals and group projects are due for graduate school and it's the first week of school for me, as I work as a behavior therapist in a school. Once I discovered this, I immediately drafted an email explaining the situation, including several other weekends that my husband and I could come up to celebrate, and apologizing profusely. I get an email back about how everyone's \"busy\", but she thought I would be the one to understand since I just got married (about a year ago) and how she went to all my festivities. Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life, I agreed to make it work, and have made arrangements to take finals early and have working with my group to try to finish our work before we leave.\n\nThe party is this coming up weekend, 4 days away. I have not been told a schedule, don't know where we're staying, how much anything will cost, etc. The MOH has been flaky with email, didn't tell me which airport to fly into (since the initial thought was bridal shower in one city and bach party in another, but who knows what the plan is now) so now I'm driving 8 hours on Friday to get there. Since the MOH hasn't been answering me, I had to text the bride asking for a plan and she said she knows nothing either, but asked if I could potentially drive people back from Bach location to bridal shower location, which would add 2 hours to my already 8 hour drive. I have no idea when I'll have wifi to look over my group project and already have to change my work schedule during the first week to accommodate this party, of which, there is literally no plan.\n\nOriginally, my plan was to just suck it up and not add drama to the situation by chalking the rude email up to wedding stress and just not saying anything; however, now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend.

And in my experience, among the population of people who say \"yes\" to that question, probably less than a quarter stay together for more than a couple years at most.  At the heart of the reason why is the question of forgiveness.  It's paradoxical and unfair, but when your boyfriend cheated on you (and I understand this was 'emotional' cheating but it's frankly worse than a one-night stand you only just found out about.  He didn't just have *sex* with someone who wasn't you, he *loved* and shared *intimacy* with someone other than you), he placed a huge burden at your feet.  That burden is the heavy lift of forgiving him, and most people can't manage it.  They'll pretend to, and may even stay with their partner for years later, but the trust is broken and things are never really the same.  You were betrayed, and you will never really stop being wary of your betrayed.  For some people its just a feeling of sadness that metastasizes into depression and resentment and then the relationship ends.

I am soon finishing up secondary school (high school) and I'm looking for my very first job for the summer, so when I was filling out my resum\u00e9 I didn't have a lot of experience to mention so I decided to do a hobbies and passions section, taking advice from others.\n\nI (stupidly) left my laptop out on the kitchen table today while I went to the shop to get some tea, and my gobshite of a sister thought it would be the joke of the century to delete my hobbies & passions section and replace everything with a single bullet point saying \"garlic bread\".\n\nNow, I had closed the Word Document, saving it, before leaving. She opened it, changed it without telling me, and saved it and closed it before I came back. She knows bloody well that I'm looking for jobs at the moment and she knew I'd spent the afternoon working on my resum\u00e9.\n\nI came home with the tea anyway and since I was happy with my resum\u00e9 (I didn't bother to recheck it, I had no idea someone would change it to \"garlic bread\" while I was gone) I sent it to multiple job applications from an online hiring site, which had places hiring in my town. I'd say I sent this garlic bread resume to about twenty to thirty institutions in total.\n\nIt was only after I sent them that I decided to re-check my resum\u00e9, when I noticed the horrific alteration. I am absolutely mortified. I immediately confronted my sister about it, getting a strong sixth sense that she was the most likely culprit, and she thought it was fucking hilarious. She literally laughed until she cried while I was standing there nearly crying from stress and mortification.\n\nMy sister has always been a joker and she gets away with bloody murder, but this was so serious. I am sick of her pulling off this shite to everyone around her, thinking it's funny or cool or something. It was only when I explained to her the full seriousness of the situation, and that I had sent it to 20/30 places, that she copped on and apologized. Not sure if she was being genuine but the words \"I'm sorry\" definitely left her mouth.\n\nThen she had the audacity to blame me for it, asking me why I hadn't checked it before sending it off. I screamed at her that I had checked it multiple times before leaving to get tea, and didn't expect anyone else to change it while I was gone. She then back-pedaled and insisted that she meant it as a joke, like \"just a prank brah\" mentality but I'm having none of it.\n\nI don't know what the hell to do now and rectify the situation. I have never job hunted before, I don't know how serious this stupid mistake is. I live in a large enough Irish town but small enough for businesses to spread gossip, so I'm terrified that they'll all now know not to hire the \"garlic bread\" girl. Should I email the places I applied to explaining the situation, or will I sound like a complete knob?\n\nTechnically, it IS true that garlic bread is a passion of mine simply because it's delicious, but obviously it is not resum\u00e9-worthy. The businesses probably think I'm taking the piss and it's extremely unprofessional. I'm so annoyed that this is my first impression in the working world, I'm not even hired and I've fucked up already. Should I resend them my application with my resum\u00e9 fixed? Should I move on and forget about the places I applied and apply to new businesses with a rectified resum\u00e9?

To answer in depth questions: it is a physical disability, no it is not at all weight related, I am following all the medical guidelines possible regarding healing though not everything is known about this condition. Yes I am trying my best, no I am never abusive towards him, yes I am able to emotionally support him when he needs it. Yes he has to help me physically sometimes for example pushing my wheelchair and making the majority of meals. No it is not expected to get worse over time although nobody can know for sure. Yes he has to emotionally support me too when anxiety or grief about this condition get to me. Hopefully that now gives everyone enough information to go off.\n\nEdit 2: thank you for all the lovely validating replies.

We're from 2 different countries, and we're living in another one. When we have visitors, they have to stay a while because it takes a while and a bit of money to get here. \n\nI'm running into a recurring problem when we have older visitors coming, from both our families.\n\nThe house we bought is not perfect and needs some work, but it\u2019s perfectly liveable. We know we have some large expensive chuncks of renovation that will need to be done (new roof, better isolation) and we've been saving up for these. There are other problems that are small or more cosmetic that would cost some money to fix, but we chose to set these aside while saving up for the rest.\n\nMy issue is that when older visitors come (and it's only older people), they decide to go off and fix my house even when I ask them not to.\n\nExample 1: Boyfriend's parents come over for a visit. There was some ivy growing on a wall outside that would need a trim within a couple month. However, our ladder is broken, and my boyfriend knows he can get a ladder from his work in a couple weeks. My father in law decides he's going to trim the ivy, and I explain to him that we don't have a safe ladder to do so, and I'll get to it in a couple weeks. I leave him alone a few minutes to take a shower, and come back outside to find him having built a completely unsafe table to stand on to reach the top of the ivy (like, even less safe than he broken ladder) and trim it. I asked him five times to come down because I could see the structure wobbling and I was terrified he'd fall and get hurt. He ignored me, and when he eventually came down smiled and said \"see, nothing happened\". I was furious. I told him I was angry at him, and even that didn't get through to him.\n\nExample 2: My dad visits with my aunt and uncle. One of the small issues with the house is that the water pressure isn't great. I know the cause, and I know it will take a plumber to have it fixed - we need to replace some pipes that are placed in a way that we need a professional. It's actually not a big bother - just don't do the dishes at the same time someone takes a shower and no one even notices the problem. my dad and uncle decide that they want to fix it anyway. I tells them not to - and explain why I know it will take a professional. Same as with my FIL - I go do something else and before I know it, they've cut the main water to fix the pipes. I go tell them to stop and they don't. Short of me physically pushing them away, I try everything to stop them, no luck. Exactly as I had planned, though, the problem can only be fixed by a professional, and long story short, they mess things enough that we have to cut the water to the whole house until a plumber can be called. It's Sunday night, so I only got someone coming around the next morning. I had to dip into the structural changes savings fund to pay the plumber, and the long term issue with the pressure is still there - we still have to replace the pipes some day. Again, I was furious at my dad and uncle, and they didn't even apologize.\n\nExample 3: my mom is over this week. She was making food in a very nice iron pan we have that we have been seasoning for over a year. This means the bottom of the pan is blackened. If this was a teflon pan, it would be a sign it's unusable, but for an iron pan, it means it's just right. I told that to my mom multiple times, but would not believe me and tried to scrub off the seasoning behind my back, causing small specks to go in the food. Again, these are not dangerous, but we do need to redo the seasoning on the pan now. She nearly destroyed the pan and would not believe me until I made her read the manufacturer's website. \n\nI am a very conflict-avoiding person.

Sorry in advance for this rambling mess.\n\nSince my wife and I got married three years ago, things have been\u2026off. I know that people grow and change with time, but around our wedding, my wife changed drastically. She bleached her dark brown hair blonde right before the ceremony, and I honestly thought I was in the wrong church for a split second when she came down the aisle. We moved into our house right after the honeymoon, and she went into full domestic mode. We\u2019d shared cleaning duties before, but once we moved into the house, she became INSISTENT on doing everything before I could even get to it. Since this is our first house, I thought it was some kind of homeowner nesting thing, but it never stopped.\nHer hair color is none of my business and I think most people would be happy not to have to clean, so I honestly didn\u2019t really think much of either of those things at the time. The big thing has always been how closed off she got after the wedding. When we were dating, she\u2019d tell me long rambling stories about her feelings and rant to me when she was upset and all that, and I liked hearing about what was going on inside her head. After the wedding, that stopped pretty abruptly. If I ask her how her day is, she will only ever tell me that it was \u201cfine!\u201d or \u201csuper!\u201d She doesn\u2019t talk to me about her feelings anymore, ever, even when I explicitly ask \u201chow do you feel about x?\u201d She also stopped telling me about anything important that happened to her. About a year after we got married, her grandfather died. Did she tell me she\u2019d lost her grandfather? No. She told me that she had to go to a conference for work on the other side of the country, which I thought nothing of. On the second day she was gone, her older brother texted me to tell me that my in-laws had really missed seeing me at the funeral. When I called her to ask why in the ever loving hell she didn\u2019t tell me, and then LIED about it, all she would say was \u201cI didn\u2019t want to trouble you. You have a lot on your plate\u201d. After that, she went on a couple of \u201cspontaneous family trips\u201d. She\u2019s really, REALLY close to her family, so the first time she said she was going camping with her brother at their alma mater, I didn\u2019t think a lot of it other than to be slightly disappointed and confused that I wasn\u2019t invited, because her brother\u2019s cool and the three of us go camping together a lot. But the second time, I started hearing alarm bells. \n\nI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m a more secure man, reddit, but after the second \u201cspontaneous family trip\u201d, my wheels started spinning and I started to think that maybe she was cheating. This was a weird insecurity in the back of my mind for a while, since she wasn\u2019t showing any other big signs of cheating (she wasn\u2019t guarded about her phone and hadn\u2019t changed her routine/appearance). A few weeks ago, she told me she was pregnant. I was over the moon about it until I asked her how many weeks along she was, and she nonchalantly said \u201cabout 12 or 13\u201d. She\u2019d been pregnant for like three months before she even bothered to tell me! She\u2019s not really showing at all, and she doesn\u2019t usually drink, so I had been completely in the fucking dark. I honestly hadn\u2019t even suspected. \n\nThat was kind of it for me. I was sure she was cheating, and that it wasn\u2019t my kid. I thought there was no possible way that a woman would keep her pregnancy a secret from HER HUSBAND for three months. So I snooped. Yes, I know I was wrong, but I wanted proof that she\u2019d been having an affair before I moved out. One of my best buddies from college is a divorce attorney, and when I asked him what I should do, he sent me the info for a key logger. I installed it on my wife\u2019s laptop and was prepared for the worst. Now, I feel like what I found is somehow worse than her cheating. I didn\u2019t find any steamy messages, but I found out that she keeps a diary in a word document that she writes in every day. I know I should have just stopped once I knew she wasn\u2019t cheating, but once I saw my name in her diary, I couldn\u2019t stop. I read all of it. All seven separate documents, going back to way before we\u2019d even met.  \n\nTurns out she\u2019s not cheating. She\u2019s depressed as fuck, hates herself, and has absolutely no trust in me. All of the stuff I\u2019d been confused and bothered by has some kind of sad, self-loathing explanation. She hates having blond hair, but she writes \u201cI know he\u2019d divorce me if I went back to being a brunette, because wives are supposed to be blond\u201d almost every week. The \u201cwives are supposed to be\u201d thing is tangled up in everything. She thinks wives are supposed to be quiet, which is why she doesn\u2019t talk to me anymore. She thinks wives are supposed to \u201cmake things easier for their husbands, not harder\u201d, which is why she didn\u2019t tell me when her grandfather died. It just goes on and on and on. She didn\u2019t tell me when she got a huge promotion and a raise because \u201che\u2019d leave me in a heartbeat if he knew I made more money than he does. Men can\u2019t handle that\u201d. It hurt to know that she thinks of me as some kind of one-dimensional 1950\u2019s husband, and I\u2019ve been wracking my brain to think of anything I could have done to make her think this way. \n\nWhat I can\u2019t handle is that she\u2019d lied about the big stuff. I honestly don\u2019t know if I can forgive her for not telling me about the miscarriages. The \u201cspontaneous family trips\u201d were actually her miscarrying two of our children, one at five weeks, the other at about 10. She went and stayed with her parents while she was recuperating, and her brother and sister came to support her. But not me. I didn\u2019t get to be there for her, because she thinks I would leave her immediately if I knew that she\u2019d \u201ckilled\u201d our children. She\u2019s convinced that she caused both miscarriages because she smoked pot for a long time before we got married. For what it\u2019s worth, it sounds like her family tried both times to get her to tell me, but she wouldn\u2019t. She finally told me about this pregnancy because her parents threatened to tell me she didn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m just absolutely fucking dumbfounded. I don\u2019t even know what to think right now. I\u2019m just so baffled because everything she says about me in her diary is insanely nice. She goes on for pages and pages about how much she loves me and how she thinks I\u2019m her soul mate and how she would do anything for me. I just can\u2019t understand why she thinks that I would leave her. Knowing that she\u2019s spent the last three years walking on eggshells around me, convinced that I would leave her at the drop of a hat is just so\u2026confusing and awful. I feel like our marriage is some kind of lie. The woman I thought was self-confident and ready to take on the world is actually full of self-loathing and really, really, REALLY depressed. I don\u2019t know her at all. She\u2019s been suffering silently with depression long before we met. She has no faith in me, no trust. She thinks that every hug and kiss I give her and every \u201cI love you\u201d I say is a lie. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. She obviously needs serious help, but I don\u2019t know how to get it for her. I can\u2019t tell her that I read her diary.

I feel like I need to get my in-laws on board somehow, but I don\u2019t know what to say to them. I know I can\u2019t ignore this, but I feel like any move is the wrong move. What do I do??\n\nTl;dr: thought wife was cheating so I snooped and read her diary. She's actually insanely depressed, has secretly miscarried two of our children, and doesn't trust me one iota.

It's nuts that she expects an apology, if I was your sister I'd be pressing charges JUST because she has the nerve to expect an apology after slapping me. \n\nI don't think you should just let this go- it just reinforces that her behavior has no consequences, which I suspect is what usually happens if her first thought was to slap your sister, then expect an apology.

I would also stay away from any family gathering until she profusely apologises to your sister.  \n\nShe sounds a little unhinged, and your boyfriend should be completely siding with you on this matter, he should have no issue to you blanking his mother until she becomes an adult and fixes the problem she caused.", "Wow. That is an awful story.  \n\nThe mother isn't going to change. Maybe she's so unbelievably embarrassed by her behaviour that she can't even acknowledge it to herself yet (the preposterous defense that you & Jessi should apologise to her! that is rich!). Maybe she'll come around to it, but I wouldn't hold my breath. You're not obliged to give her the space to do that either.  Her actions were wildly outrageous; her 'defense' is ridiculous and *offensive*; she's only going to dig in. \n\nAnd then among the 3 of you, there will always be this outlandish damage done by her, for which she takes no responsibility, and which she's gotten away with--in a way reinforcing that she can act with assault, gaslighting and accusation... with no personal consequences.

The fact your boyfriend will be 'in the middle' for as long as he tries to appease her is true no matter what you & Jessi do. \n\nLet Jessi decide about filing charges. \n\nTell the BF there will be no contact or communication on your part.

Things are good between us.\n\nLast night this happened: my boyfriend's mom went out with her friends to watch a movie and Jessi was there as well with her boyfriend. After the movie one of her friends saw Jessi with her boyfriend. She asked her if that girl is her son's boyfriend (I met this friend at a party a few weeks ago). So she looked at Jessi and thought yes, she is.\n\nShe went to her and asked what the fuck is going on. Jessi was confused since she hadn't met her before, and she kept asking her what the fuck is this. At that point she was holding Jessi's arm and she told her to let her go and called her a crazy bitch. Eventually she told Jessi that she's cheating on her son and called her by my name, and Jessi told her that that's her twin sister. She slapped her across the face and told her to stop lying. Her friends then collected her and took her away.\n\nShe then called my boyfriend and told him that she's found her girlfriend with another man. I was with my boyfriend at that time. He quickly got it that she must have seen Jessi so he told her and she hung up. She then left. I talked to Jessi, she didn't even apologize to her. After she found out what she's done, she just left.\n\nSo my boyfriend talked to her again and an apology is not coming. She feels like she did nothing wrong and she was justified in whatever she did since I hadn't told her that I had a twin sister, so she's justified in harassing her like that and slapping her across the face. She said that she expects an apology for being called a crazy bitch.\n\nI'm really pissed at her for what she did and the least she can do is apologize to Jessi. We were planning to visit my boyfriend's parents this weekend but now I'm not sure that I want to go. I can't just sit there and tell her how cute it was that she mistook me with my twin.

He seemed like a nice catch to any outsider; he was tall, handsome, very confident, a doctor, basically the sort of guy any woman would swoon over.  Unfortunately he was a sociopathic unrepentant narcissist devoid of any empathy who would take out his anger on anybody he felt beneath him and seemed to enjoy doing it.\n\nYou know how basically they say, don't look at how your partner treats you, look at how he treats others, and thats how he'll eventually treat you? My sister didn't pick up on that. I picked up on it early, this guy was really mean, would berate and insult people for the smallest thing and would lose his cool with anybody who looked at him the wrong way.  He started doing it to me, and I told my sister early on this guy's an asshole.  She was like \"nah, you two will eventually get along, you just got off on the wrong start\".  I told him I've seen him do that to other people, but she seemed to think \"oh, but he's nice to ME, I'm the SPECIAL one, maybe I can change him!\" Or I have no idea what she was thinking.\n\nAfter about 2 years together, when they were engaged, the cracks were evident.  My parents loved him, his dad and my dad go way back, they both went to the same medical school together and have been close friends for decades.  Her fiance is also good friends with my two older brothers.  After 2 years, my sister was realising this guy was an asshole, he's always been an asshole, and he won't change.  There was a really painfully obvious example one day when we were having dinner, and my sister's fiance and my dad were having a discussion about something political.  My sister tried to offer her opinion into the discussion, and they both snickered, then this guy just started berating her and ripping into her infront of everyone, making her feel this small.  I could sense her pain, she was just quiet and just sat there taking it.  I was thinking \"what are you doing with this guy, he has no respect for you, he has no love for you.\"  \n\nAnother time our family was at this dinner function where a lot of big people were around.  My sister's fiance completely left my sister alone at the table with me, and was sitting at this other table with two women, very obviously flirting with them semi-drunk. He just left her all alone at the table.  I asked her what was wrong, why was he ignoring her?  She told me they had had an argument earlier and this was his way of punishing her.  You see what I mean when I say this guy is a complete sociopath?\n\nMy sister and I are really close, and even though I'm younger by far, little brothers aren't devoid of wisdom, and I've been urging her from day 1 to break up with this guy before she gets in too deep.  Well now, that she'd spent two years with him and was engaged, she was obviously in too deep, and she used to tell me about all the outbursts he has, how he treats her with no respect.  We often had long discussions, just me and her, where she'd spill open like a can of beans and just divulge all the bullshit that he's put her through recently.  Sometimes she'd cry and I'd be there to help her out, but she still seemed to want to stick with him.  She actually convinced herself that he loved her behind all that horrible treatment, and couldn't pull herself to cancel the engagement what with our parents, his parents, everyone counting on it.  She knew they'd all say she's crazy, turning down this smart handsome doctor! Who does she think she is?!\n\nI kept urging her to break up, but she stuck with the \"he'll change\" or \"he loves me deep down\" excuses.  It all came to a heads when one day she very publicly exploded at him.  We were having a huge dinner, both sides of our families, and I was sitting next to him.  He kept bullying me the entire night,  \"move your elbows over\" \"couldn't you wear something a bit more presentable?\"  \"stop sticking your hand out like that, its rude\"  \"don't you think you've had enough of that\"?  If I asked him to pass a bowl or the sauce or something, he'd hand it over but then pull away and be like \"say please, say thankyou.\"  He was smiling the entire time, laughing.  My two older brothers were also snickering, they didn't seem to mind this guy was publicly bullying me and having fun with it.\n\nHe and my dad started having one of their conversations again, and my dad started airing out all his general frustrations and disappointments regarding me, and they started both talking about my life openly in front of me.  Her fiance then turned to me and started openly lecturing me, and when I tried to ignore him \"hey, are you listening to me? whats the matter with you? your dad never taught you any respect?\"\n\nMy sister just then basically exploded. She was sitting at the other side of the table (guessing she didn't want to be near him) but she was watching what was going on the entire time.  She just stood up and completely exploded, it was horribly frightening and scary.  She started shouting at him \"LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO YOU, WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON HIM. JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE\" etc etc.  I'd never seen her shout like that or explode like that in my entire life, it was absolutely terrifying.  We were all stunned silent.  She had tears in her eyes and ran upstairs crying.\n\nI wanted to go upstairs to speak with her and comfort her, my dad was like \"where are you going?\" I told him I just wanted to see how sis was doing and check up on her, he was just like \"no you stay here, you stay seated\". So he made me stay seated until the end of the dinner. For hours my sister was up there I didn't even know how she was, my dad or mom didn't care, my two older brothers didn't care; I had to wait hours till everyone left before I could slip up and go talk to her.\n\nShe was an absolute mess, crying, mascara running all down her face like darth maul.  I told her she has to end this, she's going to jeopardise her entire life if she continues with this guy.  She has to do the painful thing now and rip off the bandaid.  I told her 'you might think its okay if he just does this to you because you can take it, but do you really want to bear his kids?  what if you have his kids, and then he starts treating them the same way?'\n\nShe finally agreed with me and said she would end their relationship and break up, it was the only option.  I just asked one thing, that she doesn't tell anyone that I convinced her to do it, because they all already seemed to have it in for me enough already.\n\nWell the one thing I asked her to do, she couldn't hold up her end.  She still somehow let everyone know that **I** was the one who so graciously helped her make the right decision.  Of course this immediately made everyone hate me.  Aside from my dad occasionally going off at me and shouting, it was mostly just the silent treatment and people giving me glares, which was easy enough for me to bear.\n\nMy sister moved all her stuff over the next few days out of her fiance's place back into her own apartment which apparently she's gonna live in indefinitely now.  Her old room in our house has been converted into a billiard/pool table room anyway.\n\nMy dad and brothers were making my life hell for me, they blamed me for everything. My mom was occasionally nice to me but she's nice to everyone, I could feel her disappoint with me ran very deep.  She didn't offer any words of comfort or advice even though she knew my dad and brothers hated me right now.  My brothers basically flat out refused to talk to me aside from a few sentence words here and there, they didn't want to engage with me on any level even when I'd try to start conversations with them.  My dad I just tried to avoid so he doesn't have an angry outburst.\n\nIt all erupted eventually into a huge fight between me and him.  He was just shouting at me on and on and on, telling me I was a pathetic loser, disgusting.  My brothers told me how much they hated me.  My dad kept saying \"its not enough that you ruin your own life and turn yourself into a failure, now you have to drag your sister down to and ruin her life? why do you hate everyone and try to ruin our family?\"  No matter how much I tried to explain how this guy wasn't a good guy, they seemed to think it was just a personal vendetta I had against him.  My brother told me that I didn't deserve to have my sister as my sister, I told him to go fuck himself.  My dad was like \"what did you say?\" I told him he could go fuck himself as well.  Admittedly, I lost my cool after hours of all of them attacking me and I shouldn't have said that.  My dad absolutely lost it with me and told me to get out of his house, he never wanted to see me ever again.\n\nI tried to apologise, he basically just told me to get out, even though I was on the verge of tears.  I left the house and they locked the door behind me.\n\nI called my sister, she came and picked me up and drove me to her place where I explained to her everything that had happened.  She told me she'd call them the next morning and talk to dad once he'd cooled down, and then he'd be happy to take me back.  I was still kind of teary and she comforted me and told me I shouldn't hate myself or take too seriously what my dad says, and I had been the only one brave enough to convince her to do the right thing.  Her place isn't big, but she let me stay there; her double bed is just wide enough for two people but it was cozy so we slept well and fine and the next morning she called up my parents home.  She wanted to try to talk to them reasonably and see if she could make ammends and get them to accept me back.\n\nShe told me to wait in the bedroom while she had a really long conversation with my parents over the phone, it went well over an hour, and there was a lot of shouting.  She told me she was stunned and she had spoken to both our parents and our brothers too, she said she couldn't believe it and was appalled at what jerks they were being.  They said they were serious about not letting me back into their home no matter how much she pleaded with them, and had said she had to go pick up my stuff from my parents house.\n\nMy sister drove over there and picked up whatever stuff would fit in the car, I didn't have that much aside from my laptop, books, and clothes, and brought it back.\n\nShe herself seemed horrified at the way they were acting and seemed to be barely able to believe it.  She tried calling them again later and the next day again; even though they had calmed down they were still adamant that I couldn't return no matter how much she tried to reason and plead with them.  She eventually got pretty angry with them too.  They were seriously trying to cut me out of their life.\n\nMy sister told me as a result she was going to cut the rest of our family out of her life.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she told me she does have to and she wants to.  She said she was permanently cutting off all relations and contact with our father, mother and both brothers until they apologised for the way they treated me and accepted me back into their family.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she insisted its the least she could do.\n\nInstead of making me feel good, it just made me feel worse and more guilty, like I was responsible for the permanent fracturing of our family.  So now my sister has completely cut herself off from the rest of the immediate family and cut them completely out of her life.  She told me I'm welcome to stay with her and live here indefinitely, as long as I want, even though I barely have any money and I'm a full time student so there's not many ways I can compensate aside from doing chores.  She said now that shes actually seriously completely cutting her family off, she'd like to have the one remaining family member close by. \nSo here I am now. I honestly feel responsible for this whole mess of a situation. I think its good that I helped my sister get out of that horrible relationship with that awful guy, but now look at the fallout.  I'm cut off from the rest of the family, they hate me and don't want anything to do with me, and I'm not welcome back there.  My sister has done the same to them, cutting them all off, she said even for the rest of her life if need be.\n\nIt all feel so horrible and terrible, I didn't want it to end up like this, our family permanently fractured apart and everyone hating each other.  I just want to make peace for the family and for everyone to love each other again and get back and forgive each other, I really wish there was something I could do reconciliate them but it seems so unlikely especially since nobody seems to want to and I'm at the centre of it all.  Any ideas for what I can do to help heal this huge rift and reconciliate my family? Or should I just leave things the way they are and get on with my life, for better or for worse?  Nothing I can do to help mend the situation?\n   \n**tl;dr**: **Sister was engaged to a massive narcissistic douchebag who my dad seemed to really like.

She called them on my behalf to try to reconcile us, instead she ended up saying she's cutting *them* out of *her* life and never wants to see them again until they apologise for the way they treated me and make up for it.

She was diagnosed in her late thirties and I remember her mostly as being sick and needing help. I used to really look up to her as super-mom who could overcome any obstacle. That was until my father died. My father passed over a decade ago while I was still in high school. My brother (36M) and I lived with my parents at the time.  I got a job while in high school after he passed, cleaned the house, mowed the grass, bought food with money from my job, paid bills when I could (minimum wage isn\u2019t much), and made dinner most nights for my mom and me. My brother was rarely in the home unless to sleep or because he wanted money. \n\nOver the years, my brother has been in and out of prison dozens and dozens of times for everything from drunk driving to drug possession to stealing from our mother to assault. He is currently incarcerated. No one mentions him or expects anything of him, except my mother who, in violation of a court order for her own protection that she herself asked for, sends him money and speaks to him weekly as well as sends letters. \n\nBack to my father\u2019s death (a seven month bout with illness). \n\nNearly two years after my father passed. I graduated high school and left for college out of state. I would send my mom money while in college and I distinctly remember, for instance, using my stipend I received in December to buy my mother and brother Christmas gifts because I knew they wouldn\u2019t have anything if I didn\u2019t. No one reciprocated, but I didn\u2019t expect it. Honestly, I didn\u2019t care either until it became a pattern over the next decade. That particular Christmas, barely 18 years old, and I was scraping together pennies to buy a cheap fridge after I came home on winter break with gifts only to realize there was no food in the house.  My brother, in a drug-fueled rage, tore down the Christmas tree I had bought and decorated and threatened to kill himself unless I gave him money because \u201cno one loved him\u201d and it would prove that I \u201ccared.\u201d It is important to note even at this time my mother continued to let my now-felon brother back into home. \n\nI\u2019ll try to skip through the college and graduate studies years but suffice it to say I met my now-husband and I spent less and less time at home. When I was home or when my husband and I visited, it was as follows: clean my mom\u2019s home, buy my mom food, cook for my mom, take care of my mom. I was and remain very clear with my mother that I will not let my brother into my life as he has threatened to kill me (over prescription cough syrup!), thrown me down my stairs, and broken down a door to get at me (and the little bit of cash I had on me at the time). I have no doubt he would try to hurt my child, my husband, or me to get what he wants. He has told me he will find me and he \u201cget me\u201d for his perception that I have wronged him (for not giving him money), and I have ZERO contact with him. I have blocked all numbers that have any correlation to him including friends he has call from outside prison. Note: My mother let him get my number off her phone. \n\nI have told me mother for years that I cannot have my brother in my life until he at least goes one year drug-free. To date, he\u2019s been unable to do so. He has stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her. She always says she won\u2019t let him back in her house, but she in the end forgives him and the cycle repeats. Next year, when he\u2019s released again, she has told me under no uncertain terms that he won\u2019t live with her but she admits she remains in contact, sends him money, and thinks this is \u201cthe Devil\u201d in him that makes him a drug-addict. He will move back in. \n\nI have offered to help my mom move closer to me as I live many states away. My husband and I even had a realtor come out and start the process of listing our home so we could find a home with space for my mom. My only condition was that she not bring my brother into my son\u2019s life. She has adamantly refused same. She has also refused to look at assisted living facilities, even though I reached out on my own accord and found great recommendations from her doctors.\n\nNow that she had surgery this week, I have had family come out of the woodwork. Honestly, I am resentful of this. I\u2019ve had people who can\u2019t even send me a reciprocal Christmas card tell me that I am \u201cneglecting\u201d my mother by refusing to take time off work and travel to her to take care of her. They do not care that I don\u2019t have the vacation days and would likely lose my job. One even stated that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care about putting groceries on my table. I wouldn\u2019t work for an employer like that.\u201d Easy words to say; tell that to my hungry toddler. They have said, \u201cWho do you think cared for you as a baby?\u201d and, honestly this one gets to me, \u201cSometimes you have to learn to deal with life. You can\u2019t just ignore it.\u201d\u2014because \u201cdealing with life\u201d includes losing my job, moving away from my toddler in his formative years, and caring for my mother, I guess? \n\nYou can probably tell at this point that I am fed up. I am in a no win position where literally the ONLY surviving family members are telling me to leave my job, my family, my small child, to come care for my mom and help her. They also refuse to put a timeframe on this; it would be \u201cas long as she needed.\u201d I am expected to care for her 24/7, no questions asked. I also strongly feel like they are taking their own resentment at my mother asking them for favors out on me, though I have explained multiple times that I offered for her to stay with us and have the surgery here (at no cost to her, mind you) and she declined. They tell me in response she has a \u201cright to be near her friends.\u201d I have also tried to explain that by bending down to her every beck and call, they are enabling her, but they don\u2019t want to hear it. They do not seem to hear me when I try to explain that, for example, helping her check out of physical therapy facility a week and a half before her doctor\u2019s recommendation, is enabling her and in the long run, not good for her independence. She has grown accustomed to everyone doing everything for her (example, on this past visit, she got very upset with me for not taking her to Wal-Mart because she had to go there at nearly the toddler\u2019s bedtime. This wasn\u2019t an emergency. She wanted to \u201clook around.\u201d). \n\nMy mother in all of this mess has taken the position that although she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant me to lose my job,\u201d a good daughter should care for her mother. I honestly have a lot of animosity toward this proclamation because my mother has not, since before my father died, called me on my birthday; tried to establish any relationship with my son (I am always the one trying to get them to FaceTime or speak on the phone); and in the last twelve years, I can count on one hand the number of times she has called me just to check in on me or my son or ask how we are doing. If she does reach or and contact, there is always an ulterior motive (money for my brother or for her because she\u2019s given my brother everything). \n\nI am at my breaking point. \n\nI can\u2019t work full-time, care for my family, and also be expected to hear multiple times a week how I am a shitty person for refusing to abandon everything I have worked so hard for to care for my mother. Despite everything, I love my mom. My husband and his family have all seen this unfold and multiple people have remarked \u201cWhy do you even try anymore?\u201d (meaning try to schedule calls to allow her to talk to / see my son). I invited her to my home earlier this month, scheduled the plane tickets, assistance though airport, etc., only to watch her play on her phone or spend time playing fetch with her dog rather than read a book to my toddler, who just wanted her attention. \n\nToday, as if a final straw was needed, I called to check in on her and she proclaimed she was going home against doctor\u2019s orders because her dog NEEDS her because the dog is sick. First of all, he has a very minor skin condition that is nearly 100% resolved thanks to her friend  giving him the prescribed ointment. Secondly, my toddler got sick this week (meaning out of daycare for three days sick), and even after I told her of same, she never once called to check on him, just like she never called to check on him when he got the Flu last year, or when he had a mysterious week-and-a-half long illness earlier this year that resulted in four doctor\u2019s appointments and a 104 degree temperature.\n\nI can\u2019t stand it anymore. I am literally writing this as a last resort. My husband is saying to go no contact with everyone (this is ALL the family I have left, except one aunt on my father\u2019s side) because he sees me crying when the hurtful comments role in and the guilt trips. He sees me trying to hide it from my child. But then I feel like I am giving them what they want, right? Look at LittleMissPotatoe, such a crappy human being and so inept at \u201cdealing with life,\u201d she just chose to ignore all of us. But I can\u2019t spend my days defending myself to extended family members I have seen in over a decade or, in some cases, over two decades. \n\nNothing I say is good enough. And nothing I say ever\nwill be. \n\nTL;DR: I have been told in no uncertain terms that I am a horrible person for refusing to abandon my husband and small child and move across county for care for my mother.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your comments and those who offered support. There were a few recurring questions. \n\n(1) I am not covered under the FMLA. My employer is not large enough and my state offers no comparable law. I have one vacation day left due my son getting sick earlier this year (my husband gets nearly triple the days off than me and has taken off many, many more days to care for him). All-in-all, I don\u2019t want to lose my job or find another one. It\u2019s a good job, just one confined by the limits of being a small company.\n\n(2) She has refused: moving in with me by either my husband and I building a mother-in-suite or moving to bigger home; any assisted care facilities or nursing homes; moving closer. She has flip-flopped on whether she will allow home care but contradicts herself on this point, telling me \u201cinsert name\u201d can help her if she needs anything or she has \u201cfriends\u201d she can call or, most common, that she \u201cdoes fine\u201d and can care for herself. She wants assistance but only *when* she wants it and only on her own terms. \n\n(3) She told me she will not cut ties with my brother. I\u2019 was able to get her to agree to counseling after my brother assaulted her, stole her car, and pawned *all* of her appliances. She moved into a domestic violence shelter, yet she refused to press charges. This occurred when I was going on seven months pregnant and when I refused to travel 20+ hours in a car, I was told essentially the same thing I am being accused of now. \n\n(4) She excuses my brother\u2019s behavior. He has \u201cgot in with the Devil\u201d and she \u201ccan\u2019t abandon him.\u201d I have spoken with counselors, Adult Protective Services, and it boils down to, she\u2019s an adult, she can make her own decisions. Her doctors, although they seem to agree she could use help taking care of herself, have refused to state she lacks the capacity to care for herself."}, {"comments": ["Firstly, I am so sorry for your loss.

I can totally understand your concern about constantly being reminded of work. cooking at night and suddenly remembering filling up syringe drivers on the counter. or watching tv on my sofa and looking over at the corner where the hospital bed sat. i wouldn't be able to feel like i could settle down that plus watching way to many horror movies would probably make it a no from me.\n\nHowever I can also see the flip side that if it was a nice case and the patient passed comfortably and the family was kind it might also be nice to fill it up with love and life again. maybe painting the walls and changing the carpets will help and once you put your own stuff in the home you might feel differently you're also young and might spend a long time in this house, it may slowly start to feel more and more like home as you grow in your relationship and maybe start a family the memories of who owned it before will fade and you will have new memories to replace them with.\n\nBut I really do feel it boils down to how much of a hard limit this for you. If you can articulate to your wife why this isn't good for you mentally and can explain yourself then I feel like that's enough of an excuse to not want to live somewhere. There are plenty of reasons people say no to perfectly good houses and they are always valid.

", "I am a palliative care doctor, who works in the community setting, so I get it.  I don\u2019t know if I could move into a home that had been a patient\u2019s, it would be such a blurring of the boundaries that we need to keep ourselves healthy in the work that we do.  When we do work like ours in someone\u2019s home it is an enormous privilege to be let into someone\u2019s most intimate space, I can\u2019t imagine trying to set up my home, and my life, in a space I had so clearly thought of as someone else\u2019s and associated strongly with a patient I had offered that degree of care to, it would feel like I was always an intruder in a way.  This would be especially if it was one of the cases that stay with you, like this was for you.  Even in the inpatient setting it can be jarring to move a new patient quickly into a bed that was just occupied by someone who you knew well, who really touched you.  This is such a universal experience for palliative care workers that one place I worked at had a room blessing ceremony for staff to help us deal with that.

We bought our first house 2 years ago and are currently in the market for something larger. We're in no rush and are waiting for the perfect house. Yesterday our realtor showed us a listing for a house that my wife absolutely fell in love with. It's a house I've actually been in before and it is **really** nice. I work as a community nurse and one of my palliative patients from a few months ago lived in this house. While the house does check all of my boxes off too I fear that living in it will constantly remind me of my work in that house. Drawing up meds, doing assessments, rushing over to their house at midnight multiple times after they called my pager frantically, calling 911 during an emergency situation , and eventually returning to pronounce the patient's death all over the span of a couple months.\n\n\n\nMy wife thinks that I'm just being silly and once we move in, renovate, and make it our own I won't feel that way anymore. I strongly disagree. I've been doing my job for 4 years now and while you certainly become \"desensitized\" to the work there's still certain cases and patients who stand out.. and this was absolutely one of them. The house checks literally all of our boxes (under our price range, perfect size, large property, and ideal neighborhood) so she's really insistent. I don't even want to go for a viewing of the house.\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Wife fell in love with a house. I'm not interested because I had a palliative patient who lived there. Am I being unreasonable?\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** It wasn't a traumatic event for me. I specialize in palliative care and this was an expected death in the home. I've lost count on the number of patient's that I've pronounced or help stay comfortable during their last days and weeks - it's something I do at my job daily.

The \"need to know\" is I have been out of the home the last 7 years, and during this time my two siblings have lived there still. \nWhile I was in the home, we were mentally and physically abused by our stepfather.  We lived in trashy houses that were covered in actual garbage, including animal feces,  and just stuff EVERYWHERE. \nI havent heard from my youngest sister since May. I am pretty sure she has been told to cut contact with all of us (us being her older siblings). My second to youngest sister is overweight with spinal issues and is supposed to be dieting and seeing a specialist that they do not take her to see. \n\nI told the social worker that I wanted a check up on them because if previous deplorable conditions, and because I am not sure about any physical or mental abuse still happening in the home. It genuinely concerns me. I told them what happened with us (slammed into walls, things thrown at us, cussing, belittling our character... etc....) And told them repeatedly I really just want to know my little siblings dont have the same living conditions we had. \n\nMy husband supported me through the call, and agreed it was the right thing to do. My siblings all discussed it ahead of time with the exception of my eldest sister who moved out before things got bad and the two who live in the house. We all agreed it would at the very extreme least let them know that they were being watched and we didnt just give up on them... and maybe my Mother and SD would keep a clean house, clean nose etc..\n\nCPS contacted my mother very quickly.  Much faster than I anticipated. I mean within 3 hours.\nFollowing this my eldest sister who lives states away and hasnt contacted me in months calls and shes freaking out on me because she \"knows Im the one who called\". I denied nothing and simply said, \"If they have nothing to hide, then they dont need to worry. Itll be over and done with pretty quickly \" to which she replied \"And if it isnt? If theyre taken away?\" I said \"Hopefully it doesnt come to that, and if it does it isnt on me. I didnt maltreat them. I didnt spread animal feces through the house. If they are clearly neglecting them, why should they have to stay in the house?\" I asked \"Would you let your children live like we did?\" She didnt answer.  I asked again, and she said \"No. Id keep a decent house but its not your job to tell someone else how to parent\".  I said \"Okay. So if this is all you called about, I think we're done here\". She told me we all needed to \"Get over what happened to us and move on with our lives!\" (She moved out long before the abuse started and wasnt around for any of it)\n\nRegardless of my personal experience, I can't help but feel like I did something wrong. I have limited to no  contact with my Mother because of her husband, and she denies any abuse ever happened to any of us... My sister asked \"Why dont you just pop in and see the conditions?\" I told her \"I cant be around (my stepfather). I refuse to subject myself to that negativity again\" \n\n While by husband and siblings agree it was the right thing to do... I still can't help feeling wrong for it.... like it \"wasnt my place\". But if it wasnt my place, whose was it? \nI really would like a third party outside opinion about what I did. \nAm wrong for reporting my family? Honestly, should I of just kept my mouth shut?\n\n\nI don't mind having no contact with my Mother or eldest sister.  They dont even know Im nearly 4 months pregnant because of how very very little we talk as it is.  So the potential of never really having a relationship doesnt bug me really.

Opening about this stuff shows a person really trusts someone and thinks highly of them so while it's a lot for you to handle, it's a weird compliment as well.\n\nThat said don't be afraid to set boundaries around discussing stuff like this. My GF and I both have eating disorders (pre-dating meeting each other) and we both firmly refuse to engage in 'baiting' type talk with each other like when the other says 'do you think i'm gaining weight?' or 'did you read about this diet?'. \n\nWe will ask the other why they are feeling like they are needing that coping strategy right now but refuse to engage in the behaviour. We always try to do it with love as in 'I will not harm you by helping you self harm' rather than  shame like 'oh my god, why would you do that?'\n\nWe also found that often it was easier to open up when you weren't face to face so phone calls, texts, walking side by side or lying in bed in the dark made it easier to say vulnerable things such as disclosing feelings or setting boundaries. \n\nAnd for really really tricky stuff as we got to know each other better and read moods and cues we used certain animal memes and photos as a proxy. It's a bit like when kids ask if teddy can have their tummy rubbed when they feel worried about asking for their needs to be met directly but surprisingly adaptive to adults. My GF and I store up our chosen animal photos and memes and send them if we don't have words for stuff yet so the picture of the snake in a jumper says it for you and then becomes a shorthand so you can ask later 'are you a snake in a sweater kind of day?'\n\nI find everyone with anxiety responds well to boundaries and a lack of uncertainty so instead of her thinking 'oh shit what if he hates me now because it's 7 hours since I talked to him about this' you can text and say 'hey, just grabbing breakfast and doing the laundry so probably going to be off text for a bit but if you'd like to talk about stuff from last night, want to chat after dinner?'\n\nThat kind of response stops her spiralling which then makes he unable to talk it through later and sets your boundary that you need time to process it. It doesn't enable but creates the best possible way to come back to stuff for both of you. I always find it super helpful when people don't leave me hanging or return my vulnerability with sincerity.\n\nHope that helps. Also if it's appropriate offer to help her with the practicalities of finding meds and therapy in your country. It's hard doing that with anxiety anyway but even without anxiety having a native who just knows how the medical system or whatever in new place works really helps. \n\nOften a lot of living in a new country is translating the culture more than the language per se. I live in the UK and have played guide for many American friends who are baffled by the NHS or why British people queue so much even though we all speak the same verbal language.

They had five kids (including my dad) and have 13 grandchildren- 6 great-grandchildren.  My grandparents are pretty wealthy. They owned three businesses up until last year when my grandpa passed away. I\u2019m the \u201cbaby\u201d of the grandchildren and have always been really close with them. My grandma babysat me until I was able to go to Kindergarten, I wrap her Christmas presents for every one every year, I decorate their house, and I\u2019ve worked at their bar on Friday night\u2019s throughout college (without pay) as they got too old to do these things themselves. All of these things were offered to my cousins but they never helped out.\n \nMy grandparents ran a horse training farm for show horses for over 40 years. This was something my dad took up with them and I quickly started to love. I rode every weekend with my grandma up until high school when I started to get busy. Even though I don\u2019t ride much anymore, my dad and I go out and clean the stalls every week and take care of the horses when my grandparents went on trips (usually every other month).\n \nMy grandparents were a huge part of my life.\n \n \nThe problem:\nMy grandma passed away 4 weeks ago. It was devastating. My grandma left my aunts/uncles/dad about $85,000 each. Money that her and my grandpa worked very very hard for. This was expected. What wasn\u2019t expected was for them to leave me a little over $45,000 along with some other things of value. I was honestly shocked. My cousins all got about $2,000 each and some knick-knacks. Obviously, you can see where this was going. My aunts and uncles were in the reading when I was told so they told their kids. Everyone besides my parents are furious. My cousins (who are adults) are demanding I split it evenly with them. I don\u2019t feel that I have to. I was very close with my grandparents and did a lot for them but this is hard. My family is very tight and we do annual vacations together/monthly parties/dinners/etc. I never expected money would tear us apart. This money could change a lot for me. I could pay off my $10,000 student loan and put the rest toward my upcoming wedding/future children/a savings account. A small part of me wants to divide it evenly just to keep everyone together. BUT there was a reason they left me this. They didn\u2019t do it to hurt anyone. I was the ONLY one to visit them and help them out (none of them took the time to see them aside from family get-togethers) but no one understands that aside from my parents. I feel like I\u2019m single-handedly tearing the family apart. My aunts and uncles won\u2019t talk to my dad unless I split the money and my cousins won\u2019t talk to me. I only have a student loan and car payment so I don\u2019t have much debt but this could set me up for a comfortable future. They all keep throwing in my face that they have families, house payments, college to pay for, etc. They keep saying I\u2019ve been planning this for a long time but I truly haven\u2019t.

My parents also want me to keep the money as they feel my family members are being ridiculous by demanding this.\n \nIs it right for me to keep this much? I feel like I deserve it. Is it right for me to put this money over my family? Or are the people who I\u2019ve been so close with my entire life taking advantage of me? $45,000 vs $2,000 is a huge difference.\n \nSo, advice??\n\n\nEDIT: there's more in the will than I explained (houses, classic cars, horses, the farm, land, CD's, etc).

He was in a band that I absolutely loved, grew up with. I had even had a crush on him for soo long before we met. You can imagine how excited I was to be able to work with him.  I had a small part in working on one of his music videos way back when (interning at the production firm that he had hired with his band.) We soon started dating after that, pretty inseparable. I would always hang out with them at the studio and spend time with Ray in his place or mine just walking around stoned, happy, and in love. He basically coached me through both my undergraduate and MFA. Three years ago, I moved in with Ray, and that has been the same situation since. I have recently been freelance writing for a couple news publications oversees/working on selling some screenplays to some studios, and it has been such a strain on me lately, but Ray had been being so good to me lately, a total sweetheart. Ray is constantly on tour/working with friends/partners in California (we live in the northeast). I'm used to him not being home or not having a necessarily consistent schedule. I don't really either (I'm sometimes in California myself with some production work I do with my old cinematographer partner.) The arrangement was always nice, and it felt really good to be with someone who understood how hard it is to manage a life on a creative schedule. Honestly, I figured once Ray got back from his business trip, he was going to propose to me. I know that's stupid to just assume that, but after how well things had been going with us, I was really just getting this overwhelming feeling of love and hope that I was just so excited about. \n\nHOWEVER. \n\nThe other day (week ago at this point), I was browsing Ray's instagram looking for a specific picture, and I noticed the \"tagged pictures\" tab on the top of the page. I'm kind of illiterate at social media stuff.  At this point, Ray was in California overseeing some stuff with his new merch or whatever. I felt myself missing him a lot, so I thought seeing some funny, candid pictures of him would cheer me up/remind me of how cute he is. So, I click on the tab and scroll down a little bit. I see a picture of this cute blonde woman, Catie kissing his cheek. I didn't think anything of it at first. He's a relatively popular musician, not like getting on any charts anywhere, but a lot of people in a specific scene at least know \"of\" him. So, thought it was just another fan. But, when I scroll down more...I see more and more pictures of this woman and him. I click on the picture for who she's tagged as, I click her profile...I'm blocked? Immediately, I got a bad gut feeling. I ended up logging out of my account and into my company's (I know, scummy but now it seems worth it). I click on her profile, and I almost throw up. Basically besides a couple pictures of food, scenery, or shopping haul shots, it's just all pics of either her and Ray or just Ray. I do some more digging and I see that HER AND RAY ARE FUCKING ENGAGED. People are congratulating them! There's a pic of her holding up a hand with a ring up and you can see Ray in the background smiling. I want to fucking die right now. \n\nIt's been 3 days since Ray has gotten back from the trip, and I don't even know what to say. He knows that I'm upset about something, I think. He wanted to have sex when he finally got home (we always have a really fun romp once he comes back) but the thought of it made me fucking sick. I don't know how to talk to him about this. I know I'm just postponing something by doing this, but I honestly have no fucking clue how to approach my future.

He said that his friends were making comments about how fat I had gotten and that he was not as attracted to me as he was before I had the baby. He gave me an ultimatum that I either would have to lose the 30 lbs in six months or he would leave me. I was very upset about the demand, but I didn't want to lose him so I tried my hardest to lose the weight.\n\nEvery day for months I would wake up and go to hot yoga for 90 minutes.

The weight slowly but surely started to come off and I was back down to 130 lbs by the end of the six months. My husband was happy and things looked like they would be okay.\n\nAfter I lost the weight, I noticed a shift in the attitude of my husband's friends. Most of them are perfectly nice guys, but a few of them are absolute pieces of shit (the same ones who called me fat).

My husband (M29) comes from a big family, four brothers, two sisters, raised by a single mother for the most part.\n\nThe youngest of his siblings is J (M19) in the six years I've known J he's always seemed awkward and a little too quiet and socially inept.  I have always had a special fondness towards J because he's such a sweet person and I was a little awkward growing up myself.\n\nJ has been struggling with some classes and I've been helping him.  My husband took me on a special dinner night to thank me for this and it was there that he revealed why J sometimes struggles.  Apparently, their dad who is now dead left their mom over accusations that J was a product of infidelity.  He was not.  But their dad was super paranoid about infidelity and treated his wife like property.  The father started abusing J when J was as young as two, beating him.  He left shortly thereafter and passed away a few years after that.  \n\nThe abuse didn't stop there.  My MIL picked up where the father left off.  The beatings and abuse is too graphic and unspeakable for me to detail it here.  It's disgusting and inhumane.  My husband said that all the siblings took part including himself.  When I could no longer take listening to the details and the extent to which my husband participated I asked him why and how he could do those things.  He went into full on defense mode when he saw how furious I was and said they were told he was not their brother.  Like that's a valid excuse?  He said the family buried it and doesn't talk about it.  That J started defending himself at about 13 and the abuse stopped then.  I asked him if anybody had apologized to J.  He said he doesn't need an apology, that he just needs to forget and in time he will.  \n\nsince that night three weeks ago I have been unable to be affectionate in any way towards my husband.  It's like I went from totally in love, the totally repulsed by him. He's suddenly somebody I don't even know.  I honestly don't know why J has chosen to stay around all these animals and I'm disgusted with myself for marrying one.  Last weekend we had a back yard cook out as we often do.  Most of his siblings were here.  J knocked over a pitcher of Iced tea.  He's a little shaky and a little clumsy but it was an accident obviously.\n\nMy MIL went off and started berating him and called him an idiot and a few other names.  She started to berate him about his hands and how they shake so much and told him to get control of it and stop shaking.  I gave my husband a look, like, \"hey jump in here.\"  He didn't do anything.  I lost it.  I went completely crazy on her and told her that maybe if she hadn't beat him and other things...\n\nAt this point my husband jumped in and told me to take it easy on his mom.  I told her to leave and she told everybody to leave with her.  J only stayed because I practically begged him to stay but she told him to leave too.  I tried to talk to my husband about what happened and why I went off.  He told me to mind my own business about his family business.  I told him to leave at this point.  He reluctantly left and has been calling, and texting me non stop to forgive him.\n\n\n**EDIT**  Finally heard back from a friend I had emailed.  She's a counselor.  She told me I atcually victimized J by bringing up the abuse that Friday night.  She says I should have simply stood up for him for what happened that night.  She says I should apologize to him for that and I will tonight.  She also said it's probably going to be the first and only apology J ever gets that's even remotely related to all the abuse he suffered \"so be ready for anything\".  I'm picking him up at his friend's house tonight.  His mom kicked him out over what happened.  Everything is happening so fast now.  My parents have stepped up big time and offered to move him in.  My dad is going to teach him how to drive and help him get his DL.  He's going to give him his old car that nobody drives.  Now we just have to convince him to accept our help.  Haven't read all your comments but I will.  Just things are happening fast I need to keep up.  I know my kids will be fine.  Right now I'm in full \"get J help mode.\"  I have not read all your comments but I will.  Thank you all.\n\nOh I almost forgot.  I spoke to my husband on the phone finally.  He thinks he's going to talk his way back.  I asked him why his mom kicked out J.  He said he had no idea what I was talking about, he didn't know.  J told me that my husband has been staying at his mom's and he was there when J was kicked out.  I will file divorce, no chance I'm taking him back.\n\n**EDIT**  Some of you have asked about the details of he abuse.  I left them out to spare you.  Something inside you breaks when you hear the details of what they did to J.  I wanted people to read this and not have to visualize it.  Horrible and tragic are not big enough words.  \n\n**Edit** Sorry I can't respond to every comment and thanks for some kind words.  But just too add some clarity to some questions I keep seeing.  No, he has no remorse, nor does he think an apology is needed.  He also feels no therapy is needed for anybody, just time to heal.   But at the same time he acknowledges that J's shaking and struggle are a result of he abuse.   I don't get this contradiction but I will get therapy for myself as well and try to get more answers.  Also Yes, my dad is pretty awesome, I knew he would spring into action if I just talked to him.  My mom is great too.  I knew dad would get her to sign on as well.  They like J, and they had reservations about me marrying my husband but that was for other seemingly petty reasons at the time.  I swear on my life that I did not know my husband and his family had this secret.  \n\nI only knew that they all seemed normal but J was clearly damaged.  He is very sweet natured but you can tell he has endured some things.  I always wanted to get close to him and try to understand him but I never would have guessed.\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr** **My husband participated in disgusting inhumane abuse of his youngest brother.

To be honest we didn't start off great to begin with, my family and I were really nice with her and tried to treat her like part of the family.

When our parents were away she purposefully left a mess that I would have to clean up. Planned her birthday party on the day of my birthday so he couldn't go. Rummaging through my room while I was gone. Petty stuff like that. But what was worse was what she's done to my brother, when he got with her he had a lot of friends, he's always been a happy go lucky, outgoing person. But she stopped letting him see his friends and going to family get togethers.

My brother's fiance came out with this demand that either they go home with her friend before the party or that my parents drive them home (again, 6 hour drive all in all) afterwards. Oh, and she wasn't even going to the party, just him. Basically just she wasn't letting him go, she wanted to ruin the party for my sister. \n\nHe ended up going regardless and as punishment, she ignored him on the phone for two days, and that he was allowed to come home when she was away to work. \n\nAnother thing is that she's been trying to plan their wedding, even though he's expressed openly that he doesn't want to get married yet. She texted my mum from his phone (he's dyslexic and doesn't type the way she did in the text) demanding that my parents would have to give them \u00a34,000 for the wedding.\n\nJust to clarify, this isn't some petty thing just because he's my brother.

There are patterns on the windows so you can't see inside, but it's common knowledge to everyone but visitors that our equipment is in there. There are two keys, one of which I have, and the other belongs to my partner. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, the pastor's son asked me if he could borrow my camera. He said that it's \"just shooting a video, not that hard\". I declined, so he asked me if I could \"shoot a music video for him\" He said he'd compensate me and I agreed, knowing that once he realized how much work was actually needed he would reconsider. Anyway, we decided to do it that weekend, and I told him to call me during the week so I could verify my availability, and that Friday was my birthday, so it would have to be before or after then. \n\nI hear nothing from him the entire week.  On Friday around 5am, he called me five times. I responded with a text saying that it was my birthday, and that I would be available the next day. He responded \"Alright\". \n\nThe following Sunday I go into the office and notice that there's a piece missing from my DSLR. My small RODE microphone is also missing. The settings are changed to auto and the picture style is set to monochrome, which is weird because I never use them. \n\nAt first I brush it off, thinking that I lost the stuff and just can't remember where I put it, and that maybe I was messing with the settings and lost the pieces myself. It's not likely, but my memory is pretty bad, so I let it go. Plus, the booth was locked and the door intact, so I had no reason to believe that someone broke in. \n\nDuring the next week I lost my keys, so I was unable to do any volunteer work. I came in on Sunday to let them know, and the Pastor walks up to me and *hands me my camera*. She goes \"the office was left open, so I borrowed the camera. [Son] wants one so I wanted to see the model\". \n\nOkay. Never mind that she's seen the camera hundreds of times, but okay. Sure. So I go over to the office that was \"left open\" to find that it's locked. Weird. Maybe my partner came during the week and left it open. \n\nSo I let my partner know later on in the week and they go put it back in the office and locked it behind them. They cleaned up my \"mess\" (as they put it), and also believed that *I* must have left the door unlocked. \n\nFast forward to this Sunday. I notice that the leftmost window has screws missing. The window is loose, and I'm able to pull it away from the wall and reach my hand inside. That's when I notice that my camera is also missing. I call my partner, and they say to take picture evidence. We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him. I ask about my camera and the missing equipment, and she says that I should have kept it locked up better (?!) and that I should have come to her when I first noticed something weird. Whatever, but okay. But he still has to replace the fucking camera right? Or at least give back the one he stole? Wrong. Apparently he has \"two daughters to feed, so he can't afford to buy a thousand dollar camera\" and she \"doesn't know where it is or what he did with it\". \n\nAt this point, I have of course told them that I'm done volunteering for them. But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past. I feel so betrayed and worthless. How could they treat me and my things with so little respect? They are supposed to be better than this. \n\n\n**tl:dr** pastors son stole my camera, they don't care. Their family took care of me when I had nowhere to go, so I'm torn about pursuing this. Advice needed.\n\nEdit: It was suggested that I add this to my post as it may clear up why I am so reluctant to involve the police:\n\nAmong other things, when I was 16, I was homeless and the pastor's family took me on for a year. They fed me and gave me a bed free of charge, and the Pastor stayed up late to make sure I had a hot meal to take to work every single day. With the exception of this incident, they have been very involved and concerned with my well being since I was a child. I feel extremely betrayed, but I am also not comfortable taking action (that involves the police) against them.  \n\nEdit 2: I'm really surprised this got so much of a response, and unfortunately although there was more sound advice than not, I'm even more confused than when I started. The overwhelming consensus seems to be to go to the police, which I am still uncomfortable with although willing to at this point. From what I'm reading, though, it seems that notifying the pastor ahead of time to see if we can find a better solution is illegal on my part, and falls under the category of extortion. \n\nI've decided that I'm just going to go to the free legal aid office near my job, as I can at the very least get free counseling in regards to this issue before I decide to involve the police. Thank you so, *so* much for your support, r/relationships I was really feeling alone and betrayed about this, and many of your answers cleared a lot up for me. \n\nThere's no way I can fit all of the details and reasoning behind my reluctance to burn this particular bridge in this one post, so I'll just say that there's more to our relationship, many gray areas, and more sensitive issues that go into this. There's no way I can respond to all of you, but I still want to thank those of you who responded. I appreciate all of the advice given (and believe me, I've read every one).

You could never leave him because you'd need him, you couldn't support yourself. He'd be able to, even have to, approve your every purchase, know your every whereabout, monitor your entire life. \"Not having to lift a finger\" also implies total passivity, at least in certain tones. It can imply a life of leisure, or a life of never going against him.

A marriage should be a partnership where each party is loved and accepted for who they are and has an equal voice as that person.

I assumed my husband Jake (5 years married) was at work still because it was early in the day. I went upstairs to our bedroom to take a nap and I caught him trying to stuff my diary back into its hiding place. Shocked, I asked him what he was doing. at first he said nothing and he was cleaning our room and found it and was about to put it back. but he was fidgety and I knew he was lying. I pressed on it more and asked if he was really reading my diary, like seriously...?, and I felt so weird saying that. It reminded me of the time my mom ready my diary when I was 13 and I caught her. I felt like a kid all over again with my privacy being invaded and being secretly judged. \n\nEventually he admitted that yes he had been reading it. I was hurt and still am. My diary is sacred to me and always has been. It's the one place I feel I can truly open up and be myself. I questioned him even more about it and he admitted he'd been doing this consistently for three years. He said he started doing it after my dad died because he was worried about me. The time was rough for me sure but I wasn't depressed. It was my dads time to go after a long battle with cancer and I knew it was coming. I don't think my behavior changed drastically enough to warrant my husband to invade my privacy and read my diary. \n\nHe said once he got started he couldn't stop it and it was addicting. He even admitted to have some pages photocopied. on the photocopied pages he would make notes and draw question marks. I noticed one or two of the question marks were drawn around entries and paragraphs where I talk about going out with my friends or seeing my family. I asked him why on earth he would draw question marks around that. Did he not trust me? I was so confused. He then deflected and snatched the booklet with the photocopies from my hand and said that I should not be so upset about this. Husbands and wives should share everything and I shouldn't be so antsy about my diary unless I had things to hide from him. He said that he feels he has a right to look at it as my husband and that he's just concerned about me. \n\nMy thing is, he invaded my privacy. I'm my own person apart from him... Arent I? I really like having a place to be myself completely... I can't even have that? I'm already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids. I've already given up a lot of my life since I got married. I don't see some of my friends because Jake says I now have marital responsibilities and I can't be attached to single life anymore. I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous. I don't know. I'm just getting sad writing this.

Nothing to do every single day but wait. Wait for Jake. Wait for work. Wait for bed time. Wait for food. Wait for my hot baths. Wait for when I can lay down for hours with no one looking. Not even enough strength to get up and go for a walk or do something productive. \n\nI can't decide if it's my marriage or if I'm depressed. I don't know how I truly feel yet about this diary thing. I feel like my privacy has been extremely invaded. It just makes me sad more than anything and Jake won't even apologize to me. He says I am being dramatic and silly and that I just need a good nap and I'll be okay. That he's just doing what is best for me and that he always will do just that and take care of me and make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us.. He wants me to stay home for fourth of July and not go anywhere and rest instead. I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back. \n\nI just needed to vent I guess.

Even after the honeymoon phase wore off, damn close to perfect. \n\nHere's the guy I married:\n\nAttentive, sensual and comfortable with his sexuality, brave, honorable, honest, communicated well, respectfully told me when he took issue with something I had done and accepted criticism gracefully when I was upset with him, then we worked out the issue together and it STAYED fixed. A great mix of social and alone time - he didn't want to go out to much or stay in too much which was great for me because I'm very introverted with a touch of social anxiety. Nothing too bad, I'm just one of those people who never wants to go out.... then has a blast when I get there. He had a great job and goals and we were planning a great future. He was supportive of my career development (I was a late starter, went to college late). He was proud of me and always walked around like a preening peacock with me in public.

I fixed that one by saying he was welcome to go alone, but if I made other plans and he hadn't told me, I was sticking with my other plans. \n\nThose are pretty minor things in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAll out friends told me I finally got it right, half of them would have happily dated him if we broke up. Not in a creepy way, just a \"You're super lucky, he's awesome, I've always had a little crush on him\" way.\n\nAnd then we got married.\n\nI have no ue who this man is anymore.\n\nWe nearly never have sex.

It's like he's self conscious and afraid of sex now. He stopped communicating. He hates everything about me. I'm Buddhist, he's agnostic, but he used to be interested in what I had to say about my beliefs. Very interested. I never tried to convert him, it's just a part of my life I value. He used to love intellectual and philosphical discussions about Buddhism, now he just tunes out or says \"ok\". That's his go to for anything. My needs, my thoughts, my feelings, my concerns, my likes and dislikes are all met with \"ok\". \n\nWe never go out anymore. I mean NEVER. I still sometimes go to events with friends, he isn't interested. \n\nHe quit his job without telling me because he \"hated it\" and took a job as a delivery driver for Amazon. This was like a $40k yr PAY CUT. There is no money for the training and class I need for my career. But yet he finds money for his collectibles and whatever he wants. If I ask, he says it's my problem. I need to fund my own advancement. Which would be right, to a point, except it would advance US. And he HAD been helping. He had agreed to continue to.\n\nHe does nothing around the house anymore.

There was a sink full of dishes. \n\nThe mommy issue is back. She says jump and he asks how high. Period. He spends entire days with her morning to night for days in a row. She has no health issues, this isn't a caregiver situation. When I've talked to him about it he says I don't \"understand\" what it's like to have family (I'm NC with my abusive mother, my father passed when I was 11, I have a brother who lives in another country).

My MIL ended up paying for the wedding, and my mom trying to one-up her, stated she was gonna pay for the bar (it was like $300 and tried complaining about it, but everyone reminded her she didn't have to, since it was already covered by MIL)  \nThen she offered to pay for our honeymoon.  \nAnd I took the offer.  \n\n\nAnd she never payed me back.\n\nAnd that is how My husband I got our first credit card debt and my husband never trusted my mother ever again.  \n\n\n  \n**There is nothing wrong with you.** YEARS of conditioning and manipulation from her make you filter every choice, every decision you make through your idea of her judgement of you.

We decided on a very informal courthouse wedding and the two of us decided to elope/honeymoon internationally after. Well, this was heartbreaking to our parents and my mom threw a fit and tried to bargain and bully her way into getting her way.

I just let her make these plans and not acknowledging them, instead reiterating my own. It seems to be working so far, except when it comes to the dress.\n\nBackstory: My mom has always used money as a tool for emotional manipulation. Even when I was a child, she would spend her \"last dollars\" on something and bring it up FOREVER. She would talk about how she was poor and didn't have any clothes without holes in them because of me and my medical bills or things that I \"wanted\".  She would tell people on the street that she couldn't afford a haircut or dental work because of me. I separated myself from my parents financially as soon as I got to college and have a lot of debt as a result. I really couldn't handle the constant guilt trips even if it meant working full-time my freshman year. I stopped asking for anything at a young age and I still have a huge aversion to asking anyone for anything or receiving gifts. A few years ago, my parents took a page from Wesley Snipes' book and are now in a pretty bad financial situation. This makes my mom even more of a martyr when she sends me (unsolicited) gifts.\n\nThe first time I told her about the wedding, she said, \"I don't have any money, but the dress is MINE!\" meaning she would buy it for me. She talked up the experience and is clearly looking forward to shopping with me.

Anyone who's dealt with a narcissist knows how she's going to turn this around on me so I'm the asshole, and blow this whole thing out of proportion.  I never really developed a healthy relationship or mechanisms to deal with her and I just avoid situations like these to keep peace. My best idea so far was to tell her I found the dress at Goodwill. What's wrong with me???\n\nI know I need to tell her, but what's the best way to approach this with the least amount of explosion? How do I stand up for myself without being a total dick?

I have never condoned going through a SO\u2019s phone & have always been against it. However, it was 4 AM, I was drunk, and he was dead asleep so I stupidly went through it. Long story short, I found two conversations he had with two different girls, one from high school & another from Tinder, basically trying to hook up with them and saying he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend. The conversations only lasted like a week or two and unfortunately I was too drunk to remember if the conversations went further as far as planning to meet, but regardless, I was obviously devastated and shocked.\n\n\nI confronted him and he explained that nothing ever happened and he never met up with them. His reason for texting those other girls was that he was \u2018doubting\u2019 us and our relationship. I remember looking back at our texts during the time he was texting these girls, and we were totally fine, not fighting or anything, and he had been acting totally normal. Whatever it was, it crushed me. \n\n\nEver since i can remember I have had some serious body image issues that I tend to hide pretty well. I developed a eating disorder when I was about 15 and have had disordered eating habits and body image anxieties ever since. I am not nearly as extreme as I once was in my teenage and early 20\u2019s, but I still struggle with the need to be in control of my eating and always have the daunting fear of never being good enough. There will always be women out there who are better than me, prettier, more artistic, more outgoing, with a better ass and more sex appeal, the list of \u2018betters\u2019 never ends. I am well aware of how irrational this type of thinking is but unfortunately I can\u2019t stop thinking in such a way. I\u2019ve never been very open about my eating disorder or body image problems besides with therapists, because it\u2019s not something that needs to be shared. Hell, it\u2019s pretty much the norm these days for woman to hate themselves, what makes my issues any different?\n\nThe point is that any girlfriend would be devastated to find out her boyfriend was texting other woman, but for someone like me, I feel like my entire being and spirit was crushed and officially confirmed that I really will never be good enough.\n\n\nI decided to give my BF another chance but also knew that if I did stay with him, I couldn\u2019t hang this over his head forever, so I didn\u2019t. However, the trust I had in him was pretty much gone and I have been very insecure with our relationship and can\u2019t help but feel anxious and paranoid whenever he goes out with just the guys. \n\n\nFast forward a year and a half later to now, our relationship has come a long way since that entire incident occurred and we had bought a house and moved in together. I had not looked through his phone since the first time until a few weeks ago. I have no idea what motivated me to look through it again, but my gut must have been telling me something. \n\n\nI found a few texts from the night before from a woman whose name I didn\u2019t recognize. My BF texted her asking if she made it out of work on time, she replied \u2018yes, almost at the restaurant\u2019, he responded that he would be there by 6. She texted him the next morning thanking him for coming out, he replied saying he had a great time and don\u2019t forget to text him when she returns from vacation with a wink face. Awesome. \n\n\nThe night they had dinner, he had called me around 5 as I was leaving my office to let me know he just got home to shower and would feed our dog and would be home later as he was going to his parents house to finish working on the bathroom he\u2019s fixing for them. What a perfectly executed alibi. I reverse looked up the woman\u2019s phone number on Whitepages and discovered it was a 50 year old woman, who happened to be the mom of a girl I knew through a mutual friend. My heart sank. I texted our mutual friend and asked about the girl\u2019s mom and she confirmed that she\u2019s a single mom and dating a young guy is definitely something she would do, and is always trying to act younger and party with her kids. \n\n\nI then looked through his recent browser history and saw that he had recently looked up erotic massage parlors in the area, as well as watches a ton of porn. The porn really doesn\u2019t bother me, I\u2019m a pretty sexual person and watch it by myself also. But erotic massage parlors? That\u2019s just sketchy and weird.  Finding all of this at once made me feel so sick to my stomach, I felt like he had some other life I didn\u2019t know about or a sex addiction. I didn\u2019t know what to think. \n\n\nI finally confronted my BF and could barely look at him I was so confused and creeped out. I told him that I\u2019m looking for an apartment and that I feel like I don\u2019t even know who he is anymore. He said he did not cheat on me and never ever has.\n\n\n One of his very close friends from work that he\u2019s known for a long time has been battling cancer for the past 3 years, but it always seemed like he was going to beat it. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worst in early August and he was put in hospice. My BF explained that he was so upset and messed up emotionally from the bad news that he just does stupid things like this for no reason because he doesn\u2019t know how to cope and talk about his emotions. He pleaded for me not to move out and that he had no intentions of even going to those massage parlors or hooking up with that older woman and that she had approached him and asked for his business card at Home Depot randomly. He didn\u2019t even know why he agreed to dinner and all he talked about with her was his friend. \n\n\nI distanced myself from him for a few days and kept emphasizing that I can\u2019t do this again and will not allow myself to get hurt again. After countless talks, I decided to give him a last chance. At this point, his friend had days left to live and he needed love and support more than ever, so I decided to trust his word that he is the man I fell in love with. Sadly, his friend passed last week and I had never seen him so upset in my life so I put my pride away and was there for him. However, my trust for him is pretty much nonexistent at this point. Is it even possible for someone to earn your trust back once it\u2019s been so badly damaged? I honestly have felt like I\u2019m on the verge of a nervous breakdown from all the anxiety and paranoia I have about whether he\u2019s lying or not. I am so lost.\n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend of 4 years broke my trust 2 years ago by texting other girls (claims nothing physical ever happened) when I looked through phone for first time. Gave him a second chance & we have been better than ever since, until 2 weeks ago I looked through his phone for a second time & found out he had been looking up erotic massage parlors and went on a date with a 50 yr old woman. One of his close work friends is in hospice, and he claims that he did those stupid things because he was messed up emotionally and upset over his friend and doesn\u2019t know how to cope with his emotions. Sick to my stomach and so lost. Is it even possible for someone to earn your trust back once it\u2019s been so badly damaged? I honestly have felt like I\u2019m on the verge of a nervous breakdown from all the anxiety and paranoia I\u2019m experiencing. \n\n---\n\n"}, {"comments": ["I feel like Charlie should post something to the effect of \"After 6 wonderful years together, I asked koumorinobi and all her friends and family to the restaurant where we had our very first date, and there, at the very table where we sat 6 years ago, I asked her to be my wife.

This is a repost because I messed up a few of the details + I posted this in the middle of the night and didn't get much of a response.\n\nMy fiance: Charlie\n\nMy sister: Kendall\n\nKendall's boyfriend: Jack\n\n\n**BACKGROUND INFO**\n\nCharlie and I have been together for six years and have lived together for three years. We met in college. Our relationship is *awesome*. I love him more than anything and I know he's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. We're best friends, we make a great team, and we're really happy together. So no problems there.\n\nKendall and I have always been close. We've had normal sisterly arguments and whatnot, but I love her and she's family. I don't really know Jack that well, but he seemed like a nice guy (which obviously isn't the case), and we've all gotten along until now.\n\nKendall and Jack have been together for two years. Their relationship is rocky; Kendall has called me countless times because of fights, breakups, and drama. I've always been her shoulder to cry on and I've supported her through everything as best I can. \n\nShe has gotten jealous of my relationship with Charlie, saying things like she wishes she could have a \"perfect\" relationship like ours and she wishes she could have that connection with Jack. Recently (within the last two months), she's started saying things like \"I should just steal Charlie from you\" and \"I wish Jack was more like Charlie, I think Charlie and I would be a great match.\" She started flirting with Charlie (which made him super uncomfortable) and overstepped boundaries. I was uncomfortable and upset with her behavior, we had a serious talk and she broke down. She told me she was going through a rough patch with Jack and wasn't handling it well. She apologized (to me and to Charlie) and told me she knew what she did was wrong, it wouldn't happen again, etc. Charlie and I talked about it and we decided to forgive her.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Jack and Kendall were still going through a rough patch.\n\n**THE INCIDENT**\n\nTwo weeks ago, Charlie invited close friends and family to dinner (this included Jack and Kendall). It was at the restaurant Charlie and I had our first date, down to the exact table we sat at. We had talked about marriage (at great length), so I had a feeling.\n\nLo and behold, Charlie proposed to me. It was perfect, I was so happy. I cried like a baby, lol.\n\nOur family and friends congratulated us. Kendall seemed super excited. She gushed about how cute it was, started talking about the wedding, and hugged us both. \n\nThe only person who didn't seem happy for us was Jack. He told Kendall that he wanted to go home and they left early.\n\nFast forward a few days. Kendall texted me and she was pissed. She called me \"a dirty traitor\" and \"a disgusting cunt.\" I was like wtf??? I asked her why she was upset. She claimed I was trying to ruin her relationship and then stopped replying to my texts.\n\nI texted Jack and asked him wtf was going on. He told me that he was planning to propose to Kendall at dinner. At first, I felt bad because maybe he had planned something beforehand and maybe it was just a huge misunderstanding. But apparently, Jack wasn't even planning to propose to Kendall until we got to the restaurant. He saw how nice the restaurant was, our friends and family were there, and decided \"hey, this is perfect.\" He thought it would help them out of their rough patch (which is a horrible idea because marriage doesn't magically fix relationships), but then Charlie proposed and \"stole his thunder.\" He didn't even have a ring!\n\nCharlie had been planning that proposal for *months*. He's had the ring for six months, made the reservations two months beforehand, invited all of our family and friends. Even the staff of the restaurant was in on the proposal! He put a lot of thought into it and I don't think Jack's heat of the moment decision to propose is more important than Charlie's carefully planned proposal. I'm actually upset that Jack would make something this special and important into something dramatic and all about him.\n\nI didn't apologize. Charlie and I talked about it, he agrees and doesn't think we should apologize.\n\n**THE AFTERMATH**\n\nSince then, Kendall and Jack haven't talked to us. Which is fine by itself, but that's not the end of it. Both of them have been shaming us on social media, twisting the story to make themselves look like victims, and have even coined us \"The Proposal Thieves.\" \n\nMutual friends (and even some family!) are disgusted with us. They believe Jack and Kendall's story, even after I've tried to explain what really happened. As funny as it is to be called The Proposal Thieves, it's not so funny to have friends and family turned against you. I'm really upset that my own sister would do this.\n\nCharlie has been super supportive and sweet through this mess. We both agree that we shouldn't apologize and have been standing our ground. \n\nHonestly, after everything Kendall has done, I'm pretty much fed up with her. She's my sister and I love her, but after she tried to seduce my boyfriend and now this, I don't really have a desire to talk to her anymore. Which sucks, because we've always been close. I think Jack has turned her into this horrible, self-absorbed person and it's just.. ugh. \n\nBtw, I'm **not** talking to Kendall right now and have no plans to talk to her until we receive a sincere apology. Even then, I think I might limit contact if she stays with Jack.\n\nWhat do you think, Reddit? What should we do? How should we handle this? Advice/perspective/anything???\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you for all of the advice! I will **definitely** post an update after we make our post explaining the situation. I really, really appreciate all of the help and support. It means a lot! :) I can't wait to see what a mess actually planning the wedding will be, lmao. See you guys in a week or two!\n\n**EDIT #2**: **JUST TO CLARIFY!** The people who believe Jack and Kendall's story are the ones who were **not** at the proposal dinner! A large amount of mutual friends who weren't there + extended family believe the story. Our parents, Charlie's siblings, and the few close friends that were actually at the dinner **do not** believe the bullshit story. We just haven't made a post addressing everything/telling our side of the story because we wanted advice on how to approach it (which is why I posted here).\n\nTL;DR: Sister and bf are upset that we \"upstaged them.\" Spreading lies on social media.

She took a few weeks off before giving birth, and then went back to work a few months after, while I transitioned my hours to part-time so that I could stay at home and raise our son. My mom moved in with us shortly after the birth in order to help out, which allows me to get in the few hours of work per day and also not get swamped with taking care of the baby/housework. She's quite old-fashioned and would definitely not prefer this arrangement with me being a stay-at-home dad, but she hasn't said anything to either of us and has been a great help.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with medical residency, it is *brutal*. My wife has just over a year left. Sometimes she comes and goes for 1-3 days and our son is asleep the whole time she's home, which has been happening more as his sleep schedule shifted to sleeping through the night. My mom and I make sure that when she's home and the baby is awake, my wife gets him 100%. I know it's been hard on her, but unfortunately it's just going to be this way for another year.\n\nThe first big milestone she missed was him rolling over. When she got home, my mom pulled her over to the baby all excited. I thought she was going to tell her, but instead she says \"Julie, you came home right on time! He's been moving about as if he's going to roll over!\" They both stood there encouraging him, and right on cue he rolls. My wife was *elated*. She was so worried and guilty about not being there and she took it as proof that she can still be a present mother while working. \n\nSo we continued. I send texts over little things she misses through the day so that it's not completely unbelievable, but my wife has been 'present' for every single BIG milestone. He coincidentally started crawling with her right there, his first words were in front of her, and he began standing, cruising, and walking when she happened to be home. The walking one was difficult- there was a tough 7 day stretch where she just wasn't home during the daytime when he was awake, and his walking went from teetering to walking a couple steps pretty confidently in that time. We put little beanbags in one of his pants pockets so he'd be wobbly and unbalanced and it looked believable since he fell after the first step like he was doing a week ago. Yes, it was mean to our poor son but my wife's face was worth it.\n\nToday it all unravelled. So far he can just say 'mama', 'dada' and 'nana'. Yesterday he started saying 'bye-bye'.

Successfully got him to say bye to the ducks at the park, and we both gushed over his newest word the whole way home. My wife was using my phone to take pictures of him and began showing my mom at home while telling her about his newest word acquisition. She was swiping through my gallery and saw a video from yesterday and goes \"oh you never sent me this one!\" It was literally like a slow motion film happening in front of my eyes. I had taken the video of him yesterday waving bye-bye.\n\nMy wife isn't an idiot. She figured the whole ruse out pretty much instantly. I've never seen her look so upset and heartbroken before.

My fiancee Ali and I have been together for 4 years, living together for 2, recently got engaged. Our relationship has been great for the most part, one of the few things we disagree on is animals. I love animals and Ali feels indifferent towards most animals. \n\nTo give a little background about me - I've always been an animal lover. Throughout my childhood, my mom hated animals, especially dogs. My mom never let us have any pets and she used to tell us that once we were adults we could have whatever animals we wanted. \n\nWhen I moved away for college, I lived on campus for 4 years (and therefore couldn't have any pets). I've wanted a dog for as long as I could remember, but up until recently it wasn't in the cards for me to have a dog. Ali and I currently live in a not-so-pet-friendly city for renters. I always lived in apartments that never allowed pets, even with a pet deposit. \n\nWhen Ali and I met I told her about wanting to get a dog someday. Ali told me that she doesn't like a lot of dogs, but would be open to the right dog. This was in the very beginning of us meeting - I basically made it really clear that I will own a dog one day.\n\nThroughout our relationship, I would occasionally bring up wanting a dog. Ali would remind me that our apartment doesn't allow for pets (which was true). Ali and I agreed that once we moved into a place that allowed for pets, we would look into getting a dog. \n\nAbout 2 months ago Ali and I moved into a house just outside of the city we work in. The house is a good size for the 2 of us (plus extra), the landlord is pet-friendly, and the house has a huge, fenced in yard. It's a much more residential area, and there's a dog park about 3 blocks from the house. \n\nOn top of the house being perfect for a dog, I'm in a financial place where I can afford a dog. I make very good money and I don't have to travel for work. I'm mentally prepared for potential pet fees and other expenses for having people watch the dog. \n\nSince we're finally settled in the house, I decided to mention to Ali again about going to the shelter and looking at the adoptable dogs. Only this time, Ali didn't have an excuse for why we couldn't get one. After a few weak excuses (i.e. sometimes we go away), Ali broke down and told me that she doesn't want a dog. In fact, she's never wanted a dog. She was hoping I would forget about my dreams of wanting a dog. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. I'm trying to reason with Ali but she said her answer will always be \"no\" to a dog. She just doesn't like them and doesn't want them. She basically gave me an ultimatum - either her, or my potential dog. \n\nI'm feeling shitty about this, because I always made it clear to her that I was going to want a dog someday. I feel like she was banking on something unrealistic, and now she's putting me in a lousy spot. \n\nIs there a way to compromise on this? \n\nTL;DR - Girlfriend and I can finally get a dog, she admitted that she doesn't want a dog and never has.

He also didn't really see the issues that I was having with his mother, because he was always working or caring for the baby. \n\nI wanted to offer you this insight, because it may be helpful to you and how you approach your partner.", "Maybe it's time Grandma goes home."], "edited": false, "id": "bgh020", "body": "My husband [30M] and I [28M] have a 6 week old baby daughter. I am currently a stay at home dad and taking on most of the childcare. Occasionally my MIL has been helping me out but it has been causing a lot more stress than usual since she has been staying over and sleeping in our guest room.\n\nThose past weeks we have been dealing a lot with baby colic. She has been difficult to comfort unless I hold her and she does get very upset when my MIL holds her. My MIL is a lovely woman but you can't explain that to a baby. I have been trying to explain to MIL that I appreciate her help around the house a lot, feeding times, laundry (baby's clothes). I have been telling her that but when it comes to the baby crying her head off I'd appreciate if she let's me hold her. When I tell her that, especially when the baby is crying and clearly wants me to hold her, my MIL gets visibly upset. Close to crying even because she thinks I'm pushing her granddaughter away from her. \n\nThis mainly comes from her refusing to respect that I don't want her to kiss the baby on her lips, which is a disgusting habit my SIL also participates in. My MIL invites my SIL over as well to coo over the baby despite my daughter crying because of colic and overstimulation. She's not used to any of this. \n\nMy husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift.\n\nTl;dr MIL and SIL do not respect boundaries regarding my daughter of 6 weeks.

I think maybe I'd ask him outright if something was going on and tell him that I don't want to be cheated on or lied to and that if he was falling for someone else I'd rather that he just left me.

"], "edited": true, "id": "4zo0cs", "body": "Throwaway account because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. \n\nHe's a fashion photographer. Meaning he works alongside many beautiful women in his profession. Stylists, hair and makeup artists, and of course, *models*. \n\nThis is actually how we met. \n\nI modeled my way through college and he photographed me, after which we became friends and eventually started dating. We have been together now for almost three years. I've since stopped modeling, but he is still a photographer. Never once in our relationship has he given me any reason to question his fidelity. With the exception of me, he has never dated or even befriended any of the models he has photographed. \n\nThat was, until, Rachel came into the picture. \n\nI've met Rachel. She seems like a fun chick, the type of girl who draws a lot of positive attention just by entering a room. She's beautiful but her personality really shines through. She makes you feel like you're her best friend when you're talking to her. A very *cool* person through and through. \n\nThat said, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My boyfriend also adores Rachel. The first time he photographed her, he stayed late at the studio and discussed ideas for their next shoot for nearly three hours. He was actually late for a night out with me because of it, but he's always had terrible time management so I didn't think anything of it. \n\nThe lateness has now become a steady, recurring factor in their shoots together. They hang out long after the stylists and makeup artists leave the studio. \n\nThey also text a lot, and he's always smiling to himself and laughing when he reads the messages she sends him. At first he would show them to me and try to include me in on all the fun (without me asking) but he abruptly stopped doing that around two weeks ago. He tilts his phone away from me now when Rachel messages him. \n\nI'm not the jealous type but if my bf had a history of doing this with the other models, I'd let it slide. The fact that he is *only* like this with Rachel (and me, I suppose) makes me wary of what might have transpired between them. \n\nRachel herself has stopped talking to me. We used to communicate and have an easy, casual friendship via IG and Snap chat, but she pretty much ignores me now. Guilty conscience? I don't know. \n\nThe real kicker is, my boyfriend now has a photo of Rachel as the wallpaper on his phone. He's apparently proud of the concept and the editing, and claims it has nothing to do with Rachel herself, which is totally believable, but ... doesn't sit right with me. I told him that and he told me I was being irrational. \n\nRachel is single by the way. She and her bf broke up around three weeks ago, so you be the judge. \n\nI really don't want to fall into the jealous gf trope but what else am I to think? I don't want to make crazy demands and accuse my bf of cheating on me, even emotionally but he really does seem to be fond of this girl in a way that really hurts me. He has other female friends and he doesn't act that way with them. He's capable of being friendly with a girl without flirting or acting suspicious, but with Rachel it's different. \n\nHe has slowly become very attached to her and I feel like I'm losing him. I have expressed this to him a couple of times but he always tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he and Rachel are just \"kindred\" when it comes to photography. The long nights, constant texting, and phone wallpaper mean nothing. Oh btw, she's practically naked in the photo and it wasn't taken for any sort of publication; just for fun. \n\nAm I being irrational? Unreasonable? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do? \n\nTL;DR - photographer bf has been growing very close to one of his models and acting dismissive of my concerns regarding their work relationship. He has a practically naked photo of her as his phone wallpaper. Wtf am I supposed to think? \n\n**mini update:** He and I are meeting for lunch in an hour.\n\n**extra mini update:** He confessed. More on that later. \n\n**micro teacup update:** I'll give you guys the full story as soon as this post is kicked off the front page. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we're allowed to post updates until the dust has settled on the original. \n\nIn any case, thank you so much for all the advice and overwhelming kindness. I'm kind of a mess right now but I'm lucky enough to have an amazing support system and a clear head. That's all I really wanted out of this unfortunate situation. \n\n\n**OFFICIAL UPDATE:** \n [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zo0cs/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_has_become_suspiciously/)\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to thank everyone who left a comment on the original post. Your advice, your words of encouragement and support, and even your criticism has helped me immensely. Thanks. Really. \n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to address a few things: \n\n1. My boyfriend \u2014 sorry, ex boyfriend \u2014 has never taken nude or even partially nude photos of me. Although I modelled in high school and university, my primary focus has always been stage acting. He took my head shots. That\u2019s how we met. Not that it really changes anything. Just a bit of insight, I guess. \n\n2. When we were younger and when the relationship was newer, I would accompany him to his shoots all the time. But my own career is very time consuming nowadays. I know of multiple model/photographer relationships where they accompany each other to every shoot, and I\u2019ve nothing against doing that, but I personally would rather just trust that my SO is on their best behaviour. Obviously what happened here kind of squashes that \u2026 but I stand by it. If I have to be there in order to make sure my SO faithful, chances are they\u2019ll find other ways to cheat.\n\n3. I\u2019m flattered by the offers, but no, I will not be meeting anyone for drinks anywhere. Sorry for the bluntness, just \u2026 yeah.\n\nOkay, now for the good stuff! \u2026 or I guess, the bad stuff. \n\nI met him for lunch Friday afternoon. We went to our favourite sushi joint overlooking the ocean, and I ordered more than I could handle, stuffing my face while trying to decide how to broach the topic of Rachel, but most importantly, our relationship. I went into that meeting with a righteous, ass-kicking speech prepared, but I forgot every word of it almost immediately after we sat down. I guess he could tell there was something on my mind, because he asked me if I was alright, if he had done anything to upset me. *Snorts.* Yes, Ian, you\u2019ve upset me very much, actually. As soon as I gathered the confidence to look him in the eyes, I point blank asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and Rachel?\u201d His mouth flew open as if he were completely and utterly taken aback by the implication, but I cut him off with, \u201cDO NOT bullshit me.\u201d \n\nI tried my best not to let anger get the best of me, I really did. I wanted to stay cool, calm, and collected like so many women on this sub. You know the ones. Those intense stories of cheating husbands wherein the wife takes to /r/relationships, garners a ton of support, and then updates us later with a well-constructed, storybook post detailing the evidence she has collected against him and the meeting she had with her Uncle or sibling, who just so happens to be a divorce lawyer \u2026 ? \n\nYeah, I\u2019m not a badass like that. I wish I were, but I\u2019m honestly just an overly emotional doormat and I knew going into this meeting that I was either going to cry or gouge his eyes out with my mind. Because I had somewhere to be later, I took a hard left and got super, SUPER angry.\n\nHe could see it in me, the anger bubbling over. The people in the restaurant were starting to stare at us, too. In order to save face I threw money on the table (with tip) and told him to meet me in the parking lot. If I\u2019d had a switchblade on me, I can\u2019t say for certain I wouldn\u2019t have channeled my inner Jet and beat his Shark ass to the pavement.\n\nKidding. Totally kidding.  \n\nWe met inside my car. He climbed in after me, his head down as though he were ashamed or \u2026 I don\u2019t know, GUILTY?!?!?!?!?!\n\nI asked him *how*, and he explained everything to me. No preamble whatsoever. \n\nThe moment he met Rachel he felt some type of way towards her. He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was just a silly crush or something more, but he knew she felt it, too. *How cuuuuuuute*. \n\n**BARF.**\n\nThey kissed the first night they met. The night he nearly stood me up. \n\nThey had CRAZY, **emotional**, *~forbidden* sex the night she and her boyfriend called it quits.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve been fucking ever since. \n\nHe mentioned he has always used a condom with her, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m getting tested. Oh and because so many people asked in the original post, I figure I should mention Rachel was the one who was broken up with in her previous relationship. I don\u2019t know why or how. I didn\u2019t ask and I don\u2019t care to know.\n\nFunnily enough, Ian said he doesn\u2019t want to be with Rachel, he wants to be with me, and he even provided text messages to show that he\u2019s the one who decided not to pursue anything with her on official grounds, but I told him I give zero fucks about what he wants. And unless he can go w/o his eyes, he should get the fuck out of my car and erase me from his mind before I erase him. \n\nI literally said that.  \n\nIn any case, I went home later that day, posted an update for you guys on the original, and drank. A lot. \n\nMy friends and family, and most of Ian\u2019s friends and family, have rallied around me in support. I guess he told his mother we broke up and how it happened, because she called me this morning and said she\u2019s disgusted with her son and that if I need anything at all, she\u2019s always there for me. \n\nFor real, you guys, I\u2019m going to miss his family. They\u2019re good people. The best people. \n\nThis is my first \u201cadult\u201d breakup, by the way. The type of breakup where you\u2019re required not only to break up with your SO but with their family and friends, as well. These people you\u2019ve spent so much time getting to know and growing to love, are suddenly not in your life anymore and it\u2019s \u2026 well, it\u2019s kind of daunting, really. Daunting and sad and infuriating all at the same time.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the conclusion to this story. That\u2019s what happened. \n\nThank you again to everyone. \n\nIf I have anything to add, I\u2019ll do so below.\n\nTL;DR - he admitted to cheating with Rachel and then I dumped his ass.\n\n**note:** To the person who said violence is never the answer and I should never have threatened my ex - *You're right, you are absolutely right, but if you're ever in a situation where your lying, cheating ex refuses to leave your car the first dozen times you asked, I dare you not to lose your shit and say things you don't mean just so he gets the fuck out (and doesn't see you cry).* \n\n**microscopic update:** So far, his mother, his teenaged step-brother, and two male friends of his, have reached out to me saying how disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed they are on his behalf. On top of three mutual friends. It hasn't been two days yet, you guys. \n"}, {"comments": ["I\u2019m so sorry. Reading all of that, of course you feel down.\n\nYou said he makes a good living, yes? Could y\u2019all afford for a maid to come in, just once a week, to tidy up the house?\n\nBetter yet, maybe hire a professional caretaker to handle the kids for 1-2 days per week. Taking them to appointments, taking care of their needs, etc.\n\nIf you could free up just a bit of time for yourself, where you can handle other household tasks, prep healthy meals that can be stored in the freezer for the rest of the week, or even just go do something you used to love for a while, I think the entire energy of the home could be changed. You just need help.\n\nOne idea could be that you hire a maid, yes, and then also hire a professional caretaker to take care of your kids 3 nights a week for an hour or so. With that time, go work out\u2014it sounds like this weight issue is causing more problems than just physical discomfort for you, it sounds like it\u2019s really hitting your self-esteem hard, as well.\n\nTL;DR: You need to call in reinforcements of SOME kind. I agree that your husband should be coming in earlier and helping around the house more, but sometimes our spouses need to see us make a big, difficult change ourselves, and then they can begin to see the light, and follow along.\n\nNot that you haven\u2019t already been shouldering the burden of so many responsibilities in this relationship already! But sitting down with him and saying, \u201cI\u2019m unhappy, and I\u2019ve identified some of the key reasons why, and here\u2019s my game plan for how to fix it: I\u2019m getting a maid to come clean once a week, and I\u2019m hiring a professional sitter to watch the kids while I go work out three nights a week. I think we\u2019re both unhappy coming home to a filthy house, and I know my self-esteem has tanked since gaining this weight, and I genuinely think that coming home to a bright, clean house and feeling like I still have *some* time to focus on just me, will dramatically improve the energy around here, and even in our relationship.\u201d\n\nGo ahead and find out the pricing of maids and professional sitters in your area, reconcile it with your budget, and lay it out for him so he can see the benefit.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a great chance your husband does in fact love you tremendously still, but he\u2019s feeling so bogged down and sad about where he is in life right now, sex just sounds difficult. Men are emotional creatures, too, and sex is an emotional act. Masturbation is a basic release, but sex requires intimacy and vulnerability. If he\u2019s feeling overweight, in pain, worried that he\u2019s disappointing you, and overwhelmed about his house, his children, and his job, (have you asked him why he stays so late? Maybe he genuinely has a lot on his plate?) sex isn\u2019t going to sound great, despite what we\u2019re told about men basically being animals when it comes to always wanting sex.\n\nStart to contain The Overwhelm, beginning first with things that you can do on your own, (since he\u2019s rejecting the idea of couple\u2019s therapy ATM) and see if the mood and general calm in your house begins to improve.\n\nObviously, again, this isn\u2019t your fault or your sole responsibility, (I hope I don\u2019t sound like I\u2019m saying this is on you?) but since you\u2019re on your own for right now, take charge where you can, and see what things can change, so you can gradually take steps toward a healthier, happier home environment for you and your family.\n\n**Edit:** OP, check below this comment for a LOT of great recommendations for resources! Lots of Redditors suggested some great ways to get help that sound perfect for you!", "I second the childcare option 1/2 days a week. I think if you have some time to yourself to get things going as far as weight loss by prepping healthy food for the week and maybe some alone time with yoga or some other healthy activity-I liked spinning, It will do wonders for your\nPsyche. Also, getting your hair/nails done can do wonders for your self esteem. Work on you.  If by then he doesn\u2019t seem to be responding to your pleas to fix your relationship, you may want to rethink your relationship. By then, with some self confidence, you\u2019ll hopefully have the strength to do what you need to do. Therapy is also a wonderful thing.", "Oh my God this sounds so hard on you. You have so much on your plate. I think that the main problem is that you need to take care of two high maintenance children 24/7. Most people would feel exhausted and depressed and like everything is up in flames all the time. On top of that there's the relationship peoblem with your husband.\n\nThe first thing you should do is find a way to have some free time. Some time to feel like yourself again and you'll feel a lot better. Did a sitter, or a maid. Maybe friends or family. Anyone that can take some of the burden off of you. Work your problems out with a therapist and press on the marriage counseling. \n\nBest of luck", "Among other things, your husband may be unconsciously afraid to have sex and accidentally end up with a third kid. \n\nFor now, change what you have the power to change. See a therapist for your stress, depression and eating disorder. Get some respite care so you\u2019re not a slave to the kids/house 24/7. Find a couples counselor. Go away for a long weekend without the kids. The dead bedroom is a symptom of a bigger set of problems that need to be addressed.", "You mustmustmust call in some reinforcements. Hire a maid or sitter if you can afford it.  Ask a friend or family member to sit with the kids so you can clean, work out, meditate, whatever. Put your shame to the side and confide in a friend; I know what a difficult proposition this is but I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised at the love and support you will receive. Even if someone will just help you take the kids for a walk and let you vent, that would do wonders. Being a caretaker is exhausting and if you don't take care of yourself, you're no good to anyone else.\n\nIt sounds like you're probably already doing this, but depending where you live (I'm assuming U.S.) you should be able to access a variety of support services for your children. In addition to school-based special education programs, there may also be personal care assistance, a community companion, or a safe place where you can drop the kid(s) off after school hours for activities and social time. Just an hour to breathe sounds like it would amazing for you. I work in this field, please feel free to inbox me. \n\nLastly, your husband has GOT to acknowledge the tenuous state of both your emotions and marriage.

He may be on the spectrum a well. **\\*\\*How can i fix this mess esp the dead bedroom/lack of love?\\*\\***\n\nWe've been married 11 years. High school sweethearts...well started dating right after high school. Not each other's first boyfriend/girlfriend but I've only had sex with him.\n\nJack and I have been married for 11 years. We have two kids. Both of our kids had special needs with our oldest being extremely high functioning and gifted and our younger child being in the moderate category for autism. Our youngest is 4.\n\nJack is a very successful person and while I had a promising career when our oldest child had issues we decided since I made less and had better medical background I would stay home. He was happy to do this as his own mom stayed home but it was hard for me as I always saw myself working and being successful. I'm being vague because he does read this sub. I took our oldest to all therapies and was an aide in preschool for him. Honestly without driving it was over a part time job and some years over a full time job.\n\nMy life became all about pushing this child uphill and itworked Now you would never know he had severe challenges. He still gets social therapy and needs anxiety help but really he just seems like a super smart child,\n\nWe were both still very much in love and decided to have our second child. This was before we knew our older one had aspbergers. Our oldest was diagnosed when our younger child was mere months old. With a newborn I still did all of the therapy, driving and preschool stuff with my older. Around age 2.5 it became apparent while our younger child was hitting milestones he regressed. He is one of the small percentage of children who regress after the age of two. I admit this fucked with me bad and I was suicidal. I was put on medication and am dealing well with it but I felt like my child was stolen. to go from fully verbal and conversational to mute and right when his brother was graduating all his therapies save social skills therapy was a huge mind fuck. I was gutted. I began putting on more weight and my eating for comfort got out of control. I'm now trying I sti to accept where our youngest is and take happiness in what strides he is making. l take on childcare and therapies. I'm never home long enough to clean and organize it and when I am I'm usually so beat and tired to organize the toys they dump etc. Forget spring cleaning it never happens. My husband was always messy so it just adds to it being a shithole of clutter(not filth the trash is taken out and dishes done but messy clutter and unwashed walls with kid prints on it). I feel I never get a break. He is worse off than his brother in many ways but he is also the happiest kid.\n\nWhen we got married I was 130lbs and 5'8. Looking back I think I was extremely attractive but had poor self esteem as I was not American ideals and was bullied a lot for my \"ethnic looks\". After our first was born I struggled to lose weight but I did. After our second I was losing weight until my oldest was diagnosed with aspbergers. I then comfort ate. Currently I am 260lbs. The heaviest I have ever been. I'm on depression medication. Our house is a mess, I'm always stressed out and just exhausted. Jack has always been overweight but it never bothered me. I'm talking around 220 most of his adult life and he is 5'9. He is now 245. He does have some health stuff but it's minor and not severe. His professional life is super bright but due to our children's needs you wouldn't tell how well he is doing for himself.\n\nMy birthday he \"forgot\" because I was depressed and did not want to go out due to my younger child being kicked out of a preschool so we didn't even cut a store bought cake. His birthday came around and he got himself something expensive and nice and I also got him a nice gift and card. I planned a surprise party for him. I'm trying to have the kids make him a father's day gift. I make sure every day to tell him how much I adore him and love him.\n\nI feel unloved. We never have sex anymore. The kids reject him because he barely interacts-if I am honest he may have aspbergers himself- so I am putting them to bed. I ask him and he says he's tired or work or whatever else excuse. Today he turned down a bj. Not even a bodily response when I was trying to initiate it. He says it's just the kids, stress, work, exhaustion, his back hurts literally everything.\n\nHe swears he loves me and is attracted to me still but the lack of sex unless I literally beg him bothers me. He jacks off so I know it's not a testosterone thing. I've offered counseling and he says he loves me and doesn't know where it is coming from. I'm starting to feel like we're married because I am a SAHM and can bring our special needs kid to 100000 appointments and he worries if we divorce who would do it not to mention he probably would feel bad if he left me because our kids.\n\nI love him so much but either he is in denial or I am crazy. I want to stay married to him. I don't think I could ever love someone the way I love him but I don't think he loves me anymore- and again he swears he does. I just don't get how we would have sex every day then every other day after our first was born then three times a week after our second was born to now I'm lucky if I get it twice a month and I have to harass him for it. He doesn't initiate it. It kills me because I just feel ugly. I also suspect he is upset the house went to hell but I feel like I can't keep up both my kids are in therapies granted my oldest who is gifted is just in a private social group but still I never have a break.\n\nHe works until 8pm most weekdays and I feel it may be a choice. When he gets home he's on his computer or takes hours on the bathroom where he hides from us. When he is home he seems irritated with everything. We do date nights a few times a month but it's either silent or me filling conversation. I'm so lost and I don't know where to start. When I ask him what I need to do or how I can fix this he reassures me he loves me and is just tired and nothing is broken.\n\nI was raised by a single mom so I really don't know what to do here and if I am being crazy. I'm too ashamed to ask my female friends because they joke their husbands bug them for sex too much and they are tired.

Reposting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  used to work on a small team for a division of a multinational company.  We used to primarily be staffed by what were called \u201cold timers\u201d  basically people who were close to being of a pensionable age who didn\u2019t  want the hustle. That culture shifted and a lot of young blood has been  brought in. I formerly worked there and was given a lateral move out. A  colleague \u201cTina\u201d still works there. Recently an opening for Director  came up and Tina came to me for help. She's been doing overtime and working hard to get noticed for this position. She's well qualified for it and has extensive experience at the company, so she was given a chance to interview for it.\n\nTina  is a single mother who has overcome poverty in childhood,  racists/bigots in the industry and worked hard to support her kids.  She\u2019s had health issues but always fought hard. Tina is tenacious and  hardworking, but there are issues \u2013 she struggles in some areas and  while she\u2019d definitely make a great director as she\u2019s contentious, kind  and courteous, the role is evolving and may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, I helped her with her application and presentation. Beyond being colleagues, she and  I are friends; we spend a lot of time outside of work together (we\u2019re  the only women of color in our respective areas) and share a lot of our  deep feelings and thoughts. She worked hard and put together a good  presentation. I was really proud of her. She presented this morning at  9:30 and got through it and was out by 10:00.\n\nMost  of the other applicants were internal and interviewed yesterday but one  person was recommended by a senior VP in a different department. The  guy who was recommended is a 30-year-old hot-shot (I think he may actually be in his late twenties). He will soon graduate  from an Ivy League MBA and is the definition of corporate style. They  gave him a last-minute presentation slot immediately following Tina. I  attended all of the presentations (I am not on the hiring committee) but  was there to support Tina and see how the presentations went.\n\nWhen  the hotshot gave his presentation, it wasn\u2019t even close. The 20 of us  sat in the room and were dumbfounded. Not only was his presentation  visually appealing but he noticed details none of us ever did and he  developed a pitch that was so innovative that our AVP asked to use a tag  line he created. His technical analysis was so spot-on that it was  spooky. He understood issues facing our business unit without having to  be told and had ready solutions to solve the problems. Questions they  asked him were more about how he\u2019ll do things *when*  he takes over the role. It was made very clear to him that this was his  job and they even provided an unofficial tentative start date. It is  very clear that he understands the industry and his past experiences,  such as professional work experience as well as winning top case  competitions and academic awards prepared him very well. The  presentations were in totally different leagues.\n\nAfter  he finished, he made a self-deprecating joke and took questions. He  thanked us and left. We all sat there for a minute chatting when the AVP  very loudly told the HR director to offer significantly above the  salary and hammer-out a start date immediately and get a contract  signed. The VP who recommended him knew him from the MBA program as the  VP is a case coach there. He said he\u2019d be his reference and they are  skipping all the formalities and going right to the offer.\n\nTina has no idea. She was so happy with her performance and she's *sure*  she nailed it. She did well, about as well as the other candidates, but  this guy is out-and-out in a different league. Just based on that I too  would hire the other guy. She's sitting on cloud 9 at her desk and  planning a celebratory dinner to celebrate her performance (she was told  decisions would be made in a couple of weeks). At this rate, it's  likely she'll be informed that she didn't get the job well before 5 PM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  really don't know what to do or say.

I've been saying Mommy doesn't know where Daddy is (true until now) and she doesn't have a father because Daddy wasn't ready to be one when she was born.

I want him to just go away.\n\nI wanted to not even cash the check and to tell him to take his money and shove it but my parents and close friends reminded me that that is Faith's money and she is entitled to it and I agree.\n\nAt minimum I want to get some child support going because Faith deserves all the financial assistance and opportunities she can get.\n\nHowever I know if I get regular child support Tom will want to be in Faith's life and frankly, I don't want that. I don't want him to hurt her and bail when life gets hard, because it IS when you have a kid. I also feel like he doesn't deserve her. 4 year olds are a lot more fun than infants. How convenient he suddenly shows up and wants to be a \"dad\" when the hardest part is out of the way.\n\nBut. I honestly do want what's best for Faith. I think she deserves to have a GOOD daddy. I just don't think Tom is. I think Faith is better off having no dad than a bad or half assed one.\n\nShe deserves the money. But am I right to take the money and not give Tom any access to my daughter?I can't stand the thought of him hurting her. The thought of dropping her off at his house where I don't have access to her makes me want to scream and run away.\n\nPlease help me think clearly. Am I out of line for taking Tom's money but saying that's as close as he will ever get to her? I am not convinced in the slightest he has changed. I feel like this is guilt money and I want to throw that check in the trash. But it's Faith's money, not mine.\n\nFaith and I have a good life and I feel like Tom is going to ruin that. But is it right to keep Faith from her biological parent when he has sent the money? I hate feeling like I owe her him because of that.\n\nPlease give me some advice and tough love if need be.

So, here we go!\n\nSo last Saturday, my boyfriend whom I've been dating for 5 years had a threesome.. We're very protective of each other, and we've had our fair shares of having someone chasing us or trying to get at us, but we've always remained committed. We always tell each other everything, and yes, we do get jealous a lot. A couple months ago, we watched porn together and stumbled upon a threesome video (M/F/F), and we thought it was pretty hot. A couple days later, he asked me if I wanted to add some spice to our sex life, and I said yes because I wasn't aware of what he had to purpose. He asked to have a threesome and mentioned we could hit up a bar and pick up a girl. At first I didn't feel comfortable having my man to share with someone else especially in bed. The thoughts of him fucking another girl just made me feel..exhausted and frustrated. But he kept begging me for months, and I reluctantly said yes. But we decided to come up with rules, and we were both to follow it up and promised it's the first and last time having a threesome. \n\nSo here are the rules we (mainly me) came up with: No kissing, both women have to have equal attention, no anal, and she can't stay after. He agreed and we watched some more threesome porn to give us ideas. Then last weekend came and he decided it was finally time to get it done, so we hit up a bar and talked to some girls. Well, we didn't straight up ask them to involve in a threesome. Then I noticed my boyfriend disappeared for a good 15 minutes or so, and when he came back, he asked me to wait in the car because he got someone. I was very nervous, and he brought her along to the car. We did the introductions right away, and I noticed that she was very plump. Although my size and proportions are among the average, she was obviously much plumper, bigger, and thicker.. On the way back home, my boyfriend was very bubbly and excited.\n\nWe decided to check in at a motel that was close to the bar as in \"no strings attached\" type. Once we got our room, we decided to wash up first and stuff. Then my boyfriend approached me first and started making out with me which was very hot. I forgot that \"Anna\" was there and out of nowhere, she grabbed my boyfriend away and put his face between her breasts and started undressing him. I was shocked. Shocked that she made a sudden move like that and shocked to see him sucking her breasts while she was undressing him. I started feeling uncomfortable right away. The next thing I knew, they undressed each other, and she was going down on him. I had to undress myself (I still can't fucking believe it either), and I joined her to blow him. Then he ate us out, and I noticed that he was very into her large breasts, constantly rubbing the tits or squeezing it. Then let's just say that he was fucking her most of the time, and I was just next to them force-masturbating the whole fucking time. He did do a few strokes with me, but he quickly scrambled back to her. Then she started riding him while he was nibbling and sucking her breasts and at one point, I pulled out his penis out of her to give a signal that it was my turn, but he BATTED my fucking hands away and continued with their fucking. And of fucking course, she moans like a fucking whale. I just can't stand it anymore. I felt fucking embarrassed and disgusted by watching them mainly fuck while I had to sit out and force-masturbate myself. Like this wasn't our fucking deal. So I just quickly put on my night dress and left. I don't even think they noticed me leaving...\n\nThen I left and I peeked through the windows (our room was on the ground floor) and the curtains were kinda swept sideways and sure enough, they were fucking kissing and she was riding him. I felt so fucking disgusted and betrayed. I ended up sitting in the car for an hour and went back to the room and found them sleeping naked. He had his hands over her breast and shit, and I didn't want to slide into the bed. And I fucking ended up sleeping in the car (yes fun) and headed back into the room in the morning and found her blowing him. I yelled at her and told her to get the fuck out of the room and she crossed the line. She got pissed and left, and HE GOT PISSED AT ME FOR RUINING 'THE MOMENT.' We ended up fighting big time, and I told him that he was fucking her most of the time and crossed the lines and broken our promises. He was just hysterically yelling and told me things like that can happen during threesome. I just grabbed my keys and left and haven't talked to him since then. He called and texted many times, but I felt disgusted and fucking betrayed. At this point, I don't want to continue this relationship with him or even talk it out with him.

We didn't jump into it right away without letting her know what's allowed and what's not.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I don't know if they fucked again throughout the night without me since I slept in the car.

She helped me through the darkest times of my life (i was mid split with an abusive ex when we met), and I helped her through some really tough and unimaginable things. There were lots of rumours at the time we were seeing each other and everyone assumed we were an item, but for the past two years our relationship has been purely platonic - she is (was?) my best friend and up until a few weeks back I don't think we'd even ever hugged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a week ago - she came over for dinner and wine, this is very common and normal. We had more than usual and she was over the limit so couldn't drive, so she stayed the night. We slept in the same bed but apart and no physical contact again, it was completely normal and just as expected. We somehow didn't get up and ended up staying in bed until 10pm the next day just talking. Sometime during that evening she got upset about something going on in her life, I rubbed her back while telling her everything will be ok and then we just cuddled - probably the first bit of real physical contact between us but nothing was sexual, didn't feel weird and she went home and it was all OK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis last weekend we had a hiking holiday planned, where we'd be sleeping in her van (she has a converted transit). It's one bed but we thought we'd be fine. First night it was freezing, ending up cuddling and spooning but again didn't feel sexual. Second night is where it all went a bit wrong, we drank a bit too much and the spoon ended up getting carried away - it seems to be a joint thing and before I knew it we were kissing and touching each other everywhere. It was a bit of a frenzy of this for about 15 minutes until we both stopped and realised what we just did. After this we spoke a little and asked if either of us regretted it, we both said we didn't but it was odd. She got upset and I told her it was ok - it didn't change anything and we could just draw a line under it. We woke up the next morning and it happened again, we didn't talk too much but then went for a walk and then just before we headed home we ended up all over each other again, we were completely naked but again stopped, cuddled and lay there. We both agreed it was a \"what happens in X, stays in X\" type event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a really long trip home (6 hours+), during this she would rest her head on my, hand on lap ect and it seemed very different to our usual dynamic. When we stopped at services for breaks we seemed to walk arm in arm, we kept kissing on and off but it seems strangely normal? We arrived back at her home, she lives with her dad at the moment but just before I left she kissed me again and thanked me for a wonderful weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe following day (two days ago) she came over to get some stuff I took home with me, we end up just cuddling, kissing, feeling and so on again. We are on my bed and dry humping but she has dinner with a friend and we stop it there, she goes on her way. Two days later she comes over for a film and food - we had a lovely night, she ends up staying and we end up having sex twice. This should feel really weird and strange, but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday she turned up unannounced at my place (which is not a normal thing) with coffee and doughnuts, we end up talking, cuddling, kissing again and then we end up talking about what this is - que the big problem. Neither of us were sure, she got panicky and burst out in tears and left. She said she was really scared and her words were \"I think I will end up pushing you away and hurting you and I don't want to do that to you\". I told her I would come and see her later and talk. I drove to her house but her ex was there, another slight issue. They broke up 6 years ago stayed close friends, he is a lovely bloke but in his head he is certain they will get married and have children. She's had the conversation with him but he seems to shut it off. If he found out she was seeing anyone he would get extremely angry, but there's so much family history intertwined between the both it's really complicated. For that reason she has avoided seeing anyone in the past 6 years. The reason he turned up is she hadn't responded to him since the night we kissed. I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe turned up, sad and very emotional. She explained she ran off because she is terrified of losing our friendship, I said let's just cut the romance out, draw a line under it and be friends again but she seemed to not speak much when I said this. I asked if her ex was the issue - she said it was nothing to do with us but a whole other issue, but that was not impacting what was going on between us. We sat quietly, hugged and I tried to reassure it would be OK, and I wasn't going to start hating her for whatever reason, and I am completely fine with just being platonic friends again. We both agree and say whatever happens we stay friends and nobody gets hurt but we will pull back from the more physical side. This somehow ends up with us kissing? We kiss for a little while and I tell her she should probably go home and get some rest, but everything is ok. We get up and she helps make my bed, I give her a hug and open my bedroom door so she can leave, she then takes the door off me, closes it and kisses me - this then leads to sex and we have really passionate sex for about an hour. We get up, cuddle, kiss and she leaves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI woke up this morning really panicky, I have no idea where we are, where we stand and absolutely terrified of losing our friendship. I don't know what to do or say. I've felt sick to my stomach and can't eat at the thought of this. She is coming around later to collect some of her clothes she left last night and I am thinking I need a plan of what to say/do.I cannot lose my best friend - she is absolutely everything to me but I am worried we crossed a line and there's only one eventual outcome which won't be good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm super sorry if this is hard to read, but man it felt like a weight off my shoulders just typing this out.

He then refused to talk to me and blocked me, without giving me any closure whatsoever.\n\nAfter a few months of no contact, he added me again and even though I was still hurt by his actions, I eventually got back together with him on a condition that we wouldn't talk to any of our exes but now we're back right from the beginning. He's added her back on facebook and I feel so betrayed after he promised me that he would cut her off. At first I was okay with him talking with his exes but after he ignored me for them, that's when I became uncomfortable with him talking to them so we drew the line that we wouldn't add or talk to any of our exes.\n\nAnyways, after I found out, I ended up typing a farewell message and just blocked him everywhere. I wanted to discuss it with him first but I feel like he's just going to lie to me again and I'd end up just taking him back again. Right now I'm just so hurt and I'm also scared that he might just ghost me again and I feel like that'd hurt me even more so I had to take the first step.\n\nAnyways, my friends told me that I'm being unjust and cruel. Am I? Should I talk to him and talk it over or should I just continue to block him?\n\n  \n  ---   \nTLDR: Few months ago, BF ignored me before to talk to his exes. Confronted him about it and ended up ghosting me. He came back to me after a few months and promised he wouldn't talk to them or add them again but he just recently added them again and after I found out, I sent him a goodbye message with an explanation and blocked him. My friends are telling me I'm being unjust and cruel. Am I? Should I talk to him first or continue to block him?\n\nEdit: I've read the replies. Thank you everyone for the support. Now I don't feel as bad as I should. And to those who assumed that we met online and it was a fake relationship, we actually didn't meet online. We lived in the same city before but I had to move temporarily to finish my masters.

If you don\u2019t care or make an effort to try to get the other person off during sex, you\u2019re using them as a masturbatory device. Women do it too but I feel like it\u2019s more common amongst men. & its telling. It\u2019s so extremely telling. Have you had any conversations about why he doesn\u2019t try to get you off? Why he doesn\u2019t care? Is he unsure or insecure of his ability to perform oral or use toys/vibrators/whatever else? Or does he just not think it\u2019s important?\n\nSex & physical intimacy is a big deal for most people & its something you need to really have figured out before you get married. Don\u2019t marry this guy until you\u2019ve been on the same page about sex & intimacy for many consistent months, if not a whole year, where he\u2019s put in effort to meet you halfway when it comes to intimacy. Because if you marry him now he\u2019s not going to just magically change because a piece of paper says he\u2019s your wife. Counseling is going to be your best bet for saving this relationship. Because right now he\u2019s using you as a state of the art self heating fleshlight with the HouseWife add on kit & its fucked up. You\u2019ve been together 3 years & he\u2019s never made you cum. Does he know this? That you don\u2019t orgasm from just penetrative sex? Cumming from solely penetrative sex doesn\u2019t really happen for a lot of women, & he\u2019s not making an effort to pleasure you in the ways you like/need. 3 years is way too fucking long for someone to make little to no effort towards making someone feel good during sex. \n\nTMI time for my personal experience with men who don\u2019t care about getting women off during sex:\n\nMy bf used to be insecure about eating pussy. He was a...very sexually active person before we met & yet had never really given oral to a girl (it was HS so idk if the girls just weren\u2019t comfortable asking for what they wanted or something but he never offered anyways). He was always told by girls he had sex with that he was like a fucking pornstar or something, & so shortly after we started dating I had to break it to him that I was really unimpressed by how little effort he put into making me cum. He wasn\u2019t all that great. It was one of the factors that made me not want to have sex with him. He didn\u2019t care about making me cum, he wanted me to do all this work to make him feel like a sex god & yet...I had to struggle to get him to touch my fucking vagina. So I told him, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re insecure about possibly not being good at head, I\u2019ll freaking record an audio book for you of what to do step by step if it means you\u2019ll try, & I don\u2019t care about getting off *every* time, I care that you *try*. & I said that I wasn\u2019t having sex with him until he made an effort to get me off because I\u2019m not a fleshlight for him to use whenever he wants. & he\u2019d bitch & moan about me not wanting to have sex w him every time he initiated & I looked him dead in the face & was like \u201cwhy would I be dying for sex w you when you don\u2019t give a damn about how sex is for ME?\u201d Like I\u2019m not going to this carnival if I\u2019m just gonna be the ride operator & you\u2019re the only one who gets to have fun on the rides. Screw that, this is my carnival too. \n\nthen he started caring & he makes an effort every time we have sex to get me off. & its more enjoyable for everyone now because he loves that he gets me off! & it makes him feel good to know that he\u2019s able to do it & it makes sex better for him because he *knows* I\u2019m into it. \n\nYou might be able to have that convo yourself before you shell out money for counseling, but if it doesn\u2019t go anywhere then definitely go to counseling. & don\u2019t marry this guy until y\u2019all have worked this sex & intimacy thing out. If you need more physical touch then he\u2019s providing, outside of sex, your love languages might be different. But you should be meeting each other halfway about stuff like that.

We love each other and are committed to building a life and home together.\n\nBut I crave intimacy and physical contact. I find myself crying to sleep most nights.\n\nWe used to have sex multiple times a week, but now we have sex once a week at most. And if we do have sex, I have to initiate it. I will always initiate foreplay and will almost always give him oral sex. It is rare that he returns the favor. Almost every time, the foreplay is abruptly ended when he tells me, \u201cjust get on top\u201d\u2014 so he can finish. Sex ends when he finishes. We only have sex when I\u2019m on top because it\u2019s the most pleasurable for him. Sex with him is not intimate. He lays on his back with his eyes closed. There is no touching outside of the penetration. I have to force his hands on my breasts. Sex is sterile and feels transactional. As soon as he\u2019s done, he goes to sleep. I have never orgasmed. On the most frustrated nights, I force his hands towards my vagina so I can finish as well. \n\nWhen we first started dating, he used to masturbate in bed while I would be next to him. He would masturbate before attempting to initiate sex with me. This erupted in a big fight and he no longer does this. Now I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019ve just replaced his hand. \n\nA few weeks ago, we went camping and he couldn\u2019t sleep. He asked to have sex so he can orgasm and sleep. That was obviously not the most romantic way to go about initiating sex. I\u2019ve never felt so used in my life.\n\nAfter work every night when we are home, we will kiss each other sporadically throughout the night. His kisses are just little pecks on the lips when we\u2019re watching tv. I barely feel his lips. I have to pull him towards me to ask for a real passionate kiss. I ask to cuddle or hug or embrace but he says it\u2019s not comfortable for him to do so on the couch.\n\nEvery night, we\u2019ll be on the couch (not touching, with a body of space between us)  and then he will take a hit of marijuana and all of sudden will say he\u2019s going to bed. He\u2019ll crawl into bed as I get ready for bed. When I\u2019m ready to sleep and get into bed, he\u2019s already sleeping and I have to strain myself to reach over to kiss him on the lips goodnight.\n\nAs we are in bed, his back is towards me. It is hard for me to fall asleep without warmth or some physical touch. I find myself grasping at a pillow and putting a pillow on my back to mimic that physical human comfort. Again, I will cry myself to sleep or go on my phone until I\u2019m tired. At this point, he is fast asleep.\n\nHe wakes up before me and I feel that he is. Every day I feel a little hope that he will grab to cuddle me. But every day he will only cuddle when he knows I\u2019m half awake and will do so for about 5-10 minutes before jumping up to sit on the couch, go on his phone, watch espn and walk the dog. I hear these activities every morning as I lay in bed awake, with my pillows again near me for physical comfort.\n\nOn weekend nights, I get the most sexual energy from him, but that is after him getting high all day. Again the sex feels very one sided, but at least he will tell me  he wants sex. The night on a sex night will end with him rolled over and again without me feeling recognized.\n\nI have tried talking to him on several occasions but it usually ends up with him yelling at me saying it\u2019s all not true and \u201cwe do cuddle!!!\u201d With all the yelling and the lack of change, am I doomed for a marriage with zero intimacy?\n\nTL;DR - My love language is physical touch and I\u2019m not feeling loved.  \n\n\n\u2014-\n\nEdit: A commenter asked if he shows his love in other ways.

I hope you are all doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read this post!\n\n\nI have been with my partner for 7 years, we initially met online, and after meeting in person a few times, and realizing our affection for one another, we found it promising to move in together. I moved from California to Pennsylvania to be with him throughout graduate school. All was seemingly well during this time. I have never really had any reason to not trust him. I encouraged him to very much so, to try his best to make friends, or to explore hobbies on his own outside of the various ones we share, because I have my own passions, and I found we connected most when we met in the middle through conversations about these passions, through the act of explaining or showcasing what we've taken in or learned. \n\n\nThroughout these 7 years, he has struggled with very low self esteem, and though I don't necessarily think of myself as the pillar of self love, the depth of mine doesn't reach the low perception of his self value. Because of this, he has seen and stopped seeing, both a counselor, and a therapist, and has been on medication to help for the last 6 months.\n\n\nThings where seemingly well between us, and continued to be pretty fluid. We continued to share things, and take long walks, and where pretty open ended about where we stood in the relationship, if one was feeling a bit of an ebb, the other would pick up more of a share, and vice versa. \n\n\nHowever, things took a bit of a dip about 2 days ago, when I felt the ebb, and asked him about it. Initially, he said there was really nothing wrong, and perhaps I was just feeling this way because with our schedules we haven't been able to see one another for long periods of time like we are used to, which is true. But the feeling continued to irk me, and when I asked about it a second time, he confessed to me, he had begun talking to another girl from another country, via Instagram direct messages, and though things between she and him never crossed the boundaries of platonic friendship, he really loved the initial rush of someone asking him questions about his favorite movie, his favorite album, his favorite book, all things he and I already know very well about one another. I asked if he'd sent any selfies, or anything, risqu\u00e9, and he said no, though I can't confirm, because he deleted the messages, a good deal of me believes him, because of how open he was about the initial conversations to begin with. We slept apart, and I just felt really confused the entire night, because I couldn't really resonate with wanting that sort of attention from someone else. If anything, his yearning for that type of attention, sort of hurt. It felt like I wasn't doing enough, or giving enough.\n\n\nThe next morning, though I don't have an Instagram, and am not on the app, I went to check his using the desktop version, and found that posts where he once called me 'the love of his life' or a specific post with a gift I gave him that once said 'greatest gift from the greatest girl' where still on his profile, but the words, 'girlfriend' or 'love of my life' where completed erased. With this realization, my confusion and hurt turned to very real heartache. I called him and asked if he had deleted these words from the specific posts, and with shame, he said yes he did. When I asked why, he said it was because he just didn't want the attention from the girl asking him about himself to be disrupted if she found out he was in a long term relationship. I guess this is where, I asked the obvious and questioned why someone who is just asking about your favorite books, movies, etc, would be driven away by the fact that you have a girlfriend. And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.\n\n\nAt the risk of seeming toxic, and I will take full accountability for seeming so or being so, I asked him to please deactivate his Instagram for the time being while we sort through this, his twitter as well. He did, and though I was feeling a bit of relief about that, I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened that he didn't choose to do that on his own for the benefit of our relationship, he had to wait for me to ask. Which again, just made me feel like such a toxic and controlling partner. Two things I always strive to be so far from.\n\n\nWhen he got home from work, we discussed everything at massive length, and he continued to swear up and down, that these conversations pertained strictly to music, movies, and books, and he didn't have interest in her, just interest in the initial rush of the attention he was receiving. We read a few articles, and he broke things down to me as his self esteem has never been lower, despite his career as a doctor being at a high, and his finances in order, he felt things with his music weren't taking off, and with that came a feeling that he wasn't special, and it was nice for someone to make him feel that way. I felt shame and asked him if I wasn't doing enough or giving enough to him to make him feel that way, he said, I defiantly was, but my love, and attention and affection, became a pillar he could rely on, and got used to, so with new attention came a rush, and he liked that. \n\n\nI asked him if he wanted to be single, and find that rush in dating new people, and he kept insisting that that's so far from what he wants. He wants to remain a couple, and do all he can to work on these things together. Though I can't help but correlate that feeling he enjoys with the feeling of a first date. Which hurts of course. I told him I didn't really see how we could move past this because there was nothing much for me to make an attempt to work on moving forward. This seems to be a self stemming problem, that I emphasize with, but just don't want to be on the receiving end of the counter effects. \n\n\nSo though it is incredibly uneasy to begin to think of how difficult it'll be to begin again, it is just as difficult to think about how difficult it would be to stay and try to rebuild back up an issue that I feel like just a bystander when it comes to. \n\n\nThis has all been very painful and if this comes to an end I just want it to be as civil and as possible. He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced with newfound paranoia. \n\n\nDespite this all, my heart is still very much in this of course, and he has been very vocal about how it was just one mistake, nothing happened, we can work through this, etc. And I secretly keep hoping he will make a step, any step really, to showcase these words and implement action, seek a new therapist, find the two of us a relationship counselor, buy a book on self help or on how couple conquer affairs, anything, anything at all, without me having to be the one to ask him. I just want him to have that yearning that he continues to say he has, but instead of saying it, I was him to show me. \n\n\nDo you think that makes me irrational or just plain dumb? I believe to be in a state where I can handle either answer. Or something completely different just the same!\n\n\nDo you all think I'm blowing something completely out of proportion? Given how this was an exchange of conversation between him and another girl for just a few days, and his erasure of me on his profile was only for about 2 days? \n\n\nAlas, we have come to the very end of this post, if you've made it, I can not thank you enough for giving me your time, if you take the time to post, I can not thank you enough for giving me your efforts. This has been a first in this relationship, this has been a first in my life truthfully, and throughout writing this I just felt completely vulnerable and isolated. So, if you've given me your time, thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope what happened to me, doesn't happen to you, and wish you all things gracious and good and completely fulfilling my friends! Best of luck, and all of my love and gratitude.\n\n\nTL;DR I've been in a relationship for 7 years, my partner recently and unexpectedly kept posts on Instagram that showcased us as a couple but deleted the words beneath them that included the words 'love of my life' and 'girlfriend' in order to continue to receive attention from another girl who lives in another country, who he says he shared a platonic relationship with via Instagram direct messages, and really only enjoyed the aspects of her asking him questions about his favorite things and giving him validation. He says he only erased those specific words in order to keep the flow of validation coming.

I thought we could work on that and that it would come with time. Unfortunately it did not and it breaks my heart... We have sex somewhat regularly but usually I'd rather just cuddle and watch a movie or do something else with her. Even things I loved doing with previous partner rather turns me off with her.

I could write a bloody novel here, but I will try to keep focus and give you only two pieces of advice.\n\n\nFirst, and I cannot overstate the importance of this, but **speak with an employment attorney before you make any decisions**. That includes whether or not your girlfriend reduces her hours. I don't know what country you're in, but there are good ways to handle this and bad ways, and the financial ramifications are huge. It is 1,000% worth a few hours of somebody's time to make sure you get this right. Make sure you factor in any disability policies or SSDI that your girlfriend might receive if she's no longer able to work due to the permanent effects of her cancer treatments.\n\n\nSecond, the default mindset of the caretaker is to prioritize fighting the disease and the comfort of the patient above all else. I think that's what any loving partner would do, but it's so easy to lose your own identity and everything is about the sick partner. Well, you matter too!\n\n\nYou are 31 years old and your girlfriend, through no fault of her own of course, is now in a very different stage of life from you. She's 2 years younger and 30 years older than you, all at the same time. What were *your* plans and goals for life? How do you feel about this new life?\n\n\nJust to be clear, I am not advising you to leave your girlfriend. That's up to you. But what I am saying is that you need to take careful deliberation and own your decision so you don't wake up 20 years from now filled with regret.\n\n\nI don't know if it helps or not, but I'll add that Mrs. Anderson and I were already married and had kids by the time cancer struck. Yes, we stayed together, and no, it didn't even occur to me that leaving would make any sense, and no, I am not experiencing regret. But I'm me, and you are you.\u00a0\n\n\nApologies since I'm sure this came across as callous. But it's important information, and life isn't always rainbows and unicorns.

I ended up taking short term disability from my career and going into a treatment program. It was 8 hours a day of intensive therapy and then we all went home, and half way through I went to work part time and therapy part time as I worked on my transition back to normal life. \n\nIf she works for the govt they probably have some sort of short term leave plan, and I highly suggest a program like I was in. They worked with the short term disability program and submitted all the paperwork and as long as I went to therapy I got 65% of my weekly pay, which was more than part time work, even at my company. \n\n\nThis program has group therapy, individual therapy, nurses, doctor's, etc. My health insurance covered it and for what my copay was they let me pay a little each month. If she is struggling with her physical health it could help there, too. \n\nIt absolutely saved my life, and it could be worth looking into something like that for her!

We had been dating for 2 years and planning a life together when she was disagnosed with cancer. At the time she was in school for a dual graduate degree program and managed to finish it. Treatment was rough on her and she strugled a lot through it, and hasn't done well mentally dealing with the unfairness of it all, how different her body is after surgeries, and the fear of it coming back. All perfectly understandable, and I've been as supportive as I can throughout it all.\n\nNow all that said, she went into the graduate programs after we started dating and one of the degrees was at a very expensive school for something that was only related and not required for the work she planned on doing which would never pay very well. I questioned her about it gently at the time but she was adamant about getting the expensive degree. It was her life, and we agreed it would be fine because we could utilize public service loan forgiveness to pay off her debt that would total \\~$100k. This was before cancer.\n\nI earn a considerable amount more than her, when we started dating I made \\~4x and even with her degrees I make \\~3x what she does. I've always been happy to spend money on her, and after having moved in together over a year ago and proposing shortly after I really went into the mindset of it being \"our\" money. When we moved in she was finishing her degrees and I covered 100% of our bills, including some tuition costs for an extra semester since she was slightly delayed by her treatment. This was totally fine because school was her job and she'd be able to contribute when she graduated and even though I make much more if we are both working full time jobs it felt fair.\n\nNow that she has graduated and started working, she is miserable at her job mostly because she is incredibly anxious that she isn't doing it well and doesn't feel like her school prepared her. She was already prone towards anxiety and depression (she takes medicine for it) but mentally she is in a very bad spot because of all this. On top of that she feels like she doesn't doing enough for her health (mostly exercise) to keep her healthy to reduce the cancer from coming back but she says she is too tired after work to do much else than occationally go on a walk.\n\nRecently she got the idea in her head to start working half weeks to give her more time to exercise, and stress her out about work less. She says not knowing for sure how long she'll live has changed her priorities about working. Before all this she was a pretty driven type a personality working multiple jobs. But working part time doesn't meet the requirements for public service loan forgiveness.\n\nWe've talked about it extensively and she feels it is important for her to work part time, but I am not very comfortable with the idea for many reasons. I get where she is coming from in her needs but feel like she is looking for a quick fix to her problems that puts us in a pretty big hole financially because she is so miserable instead of fully dealing with her problems. I'd be more ok with it if it was short term while she sorted through some things but she says she just wants more time to exercise and be stress free so she doesn't know when that would end.\n\nI just feel like she is taking our relationship which is already unbalanced and asking to make it a lot more so--and soley because she is in a position to do so because of my job. We can financially afford it but I haven't been able to come to terms about the disproportionality it would create in our relationship.\n\nI am just looking for some advice on maybe a better way to think about this that would maybe make me feel more comfortable with it, some opinions on if I'm just being a greedy/selfish asshole, and some comiseration if anyone has been in a similar situation.\n\nI probably left out a lot so feel free to ask questions, this post is already very long, and if you read it all thanks for sticking with me!

She is part of an online BD support group and talks openly to me about how she's met people who finally understand her, and she gives them advice and guidance based on her \"struggle\" with BD. She's pointed to actresses like Mindy Kalling and compared the actress's body to her \"actual\" body (vs. BD body) and says it's nice to see herself represented on screen.

She's since stopped doing that (or only does it when she remembers), but it made me think she might be aware of her size and just tries to pretend she has BD so no one can talk to her about it.\n\nI know this is a weird situation. I'd like to get her or us into counseling but she doesn't have insurance and goes to a community college that doesn't offer student mental health services.

I lost my father when I was 16. I've been exactly where you are so I hope I might be able to help you out here. Unfortunately, it's not all good.\n\nTeenagers tend to be fundamentally self-centered. No offense meant. It's just kind of a fact of nature. Most kids your age are completely unprepared to deal with something as serious and impactful as this. Their typical response will be to just ignore it. It's awful, but they're really not equipped to do much else. I'm sure you've noticed this in other areas. You probably feel that most of your peers are still living in a na\u00efve, childish world where everything is easy and the biggest concern is who is dating who. While you have been forced to grow up and face the real world.\n\nWhen my father died, I also lost my best friend and our small group that we hung out with. They stopped calling, stopped inviting me out, and I eventually quit trying. It was hard. It hurt a lot and it honestly still hurts a little bit. But as a result, I was forced to seek out new friends (I had social issues as well) and become much closer to the couple of acquaintances that didn't push me away. I found much kinder, empathetic, and overall better people to be friends with. Those people are still my best friends.\n\nI think you should reach out to your friend and tell her how you feel. Try not to be accusatory or attack her. Tell her that you're having a very hard time, you miss her, and you could really use her help getting you through this. Don't make it about the fact that she's been neglectful because that will just make her defensive. Make it about the fact that you need her help right now. She may step up to the task or she may not, but you should let her know that you need her help.\n\nIf it doesn't work out, you should know that there are so many other great and worthwhile people out there to make lifelong friendships with.

I love the dude, but I didn't know what he needed from me. It may just be that she's scared of saying something wrong and making things worse.

Anyway.. story time...\n\nI had actually come home a week earlier than I was supposed to from the air force (this was a good 15 years ago) and figured I'd surprise her since she'd always talk about how much she misses me, would always send me pictures of her in the mail and write these long letters talking about our future together. Naturally I assumed she would be more than excited to see me walk in the door a week early. \n\nPulled up to the house and figured she was home because her car was there so I was as quiet as possible. Even parked my car down the street a little so she didn't see me pull up and ruin the surprise. Quietly put the key in the lock and slowly twisted...opened the door and the living room was dark. I thought... hm. Maybe she got picked up by some friends and went out somewhere. Oh well even better! I'll set up our room by going to get some flowers and making everything look all romantic and irresistible.... (hey it's been a few months, I was a bit pent up at that point). Start walking towards the bedroom and I hear this rhythmic squeaking noise followed by a deep grunt. My instinct reaction was someone broke in and trying to rip something off the wall, so I went into ass kicking mode until a few seconds later I heard a high pitched moan of a female. Yeah... I recognized that sound pretty well and knew what was happening. Being in the military I knew the worst possible thing I could do was anything violent so I wanted to fuck up whatever \"moment\" they were having. I walked towards the room very quietly while they went at it... of course they didn't hear me because they were far too \"deep\" in their actions. Luckily the door was halfway open so I got down and started crawling towards the bed out of their line of sight, slithered over to the edge of the bed they were closest to and started slowly inching my head up the side until just my eyes were above the edge. It took her a good minute (she was on the bottom) before she looked over and saw angry eyes staring at her. She freaked out so bad that she kicked the dude in the face and he fell off the bed and hit his head on the wall, she screamed louder than I've heard anyone scream in my life and bounced off the bed in a flailing, sweaty mess and I heard her ass hit the ground with a satisfying thud. I stood up and the guy was in a heap on the floor scared shitless at this dude in full military garb standing over him with crazy eyes. She finally realized who it was and started bawling her eyes out saying \"i'm so sorry! I was lonely!\" blah blah blah... who cares.

I suppose littering the outdoors with my mementos isn't very eco-friendly, but I'm hoping Mother Nature will give me a pass on this one.  \n\nThird, as per a number of requests in the thread, I changed her desktop background to one of the pictures. Having to look at it again while I did so was even harder than packing, I think, but it is done. It was unnecessary, as I have already asked her via text to never contact me again, but it is satisfying to know that she will have to come home to that. \n\nTo answer some of the other questions posed in the thread: \n\n* EXIF data from the pictures said they were taken by her phone last month.\n* I have racked my brain, and surprisingly, I cannot come up with any red flags about the relationship. She is a redditor, so I am trying to avoid specifics, but they were taken while she was on an extended trip. Perhaps she thought that she could have some sort of fling with someone she met and I would be none the wiser.\n* I can't explain why she left a folder containing these pictures on her laptop. It seems incredibly stupid to me, but it isn't like they were in plain sight. They were among a number of other, seemingly benign pictures.\n* I do not believe she wanted me to find out; she seems very upset and has been begging me to talk with her about it.\n\nFinally, I just want to reiterate: Thank you, Reddit.

I don't want to get specific about that part, it's the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life, and I'm still not sure how I'm ever going to move on.\n\nWe were married for 5 years, together for 7.  The past 2 years we've been trying for a baby, but were just getting to the point of considering IVF when he died.\n\nJonah had a close friend in high school named Marjorie.  Marjorie also ended up going to the same university as he did, and they spent a lot of time together during those college years.  Jonah said that he liked Marjorie's company, but never felt anything beyond friendship with her -- which I totally believe.  \n\nJonah dated other women during that period, but told me that several times Marjorie hinted that she wanted him to ask her out.  She also \"joked\" about wanting him to be her \"plan B\" in case she didn't meet someone and get married by 30.  \n\nBy the time I'd started dating Jonah, he had moved a couple hours away from his hometown (and Marjorie).  Despite this, Marjorie immediately began finding excuses to come to our town and \"hang out\" -- which usually involved her encouraging us to go drinking, and then her passing out on the couch at Jonah's apartment.  I didn't mind her for the most part, but she had a habit of saying things like, \"you know you ruined our marriage pact, haha!\" and pointing out all the things that she knew about him (like what he took in his coffee, his favorite bands, etc).\n\nOver the course of our relationship, and especially after we got married, Jonah definitely put some distance into his relationship with Marjorie.  He confided in me that he felt he had \"outgrown her\" and that they really had little in common anymore.  He stopped responding to her invitations to hang out as often, though he would occasionally call to catch up out of guilt (especially when she would text him or leave messages saying she was \"so sad he was ignoring her\" and the like).\n\nBut now he's gone.  I had him cremated, like he wanted.  We haven't done the memorial service yet -- it was too hard for me to even imagine the first couple of weeks, and I also wanted to give time for some out-of-state people to make travel plans.  The memorial is this weekend.\n\nHowever, two weeks ago, I received an email from Marjorie -- sent to around sixty people, including Jonah's family -- saying that she was holding a memorial service for Jonah in the town where they grew up (the day before his memorial here).  I was completely blown away, seeing as she hadn't mentioned anything to me or even attempted to call.  Along with the details, the email said that she was \"planning the memorial in light of the fact that no other service had yet been held in his memory, and he deserved to be laid to rest with honor\".  For the record, she was invited to the memorial which I've been planning, and knew it was happening.\n\nI called her, of course, and told her that while I appreciated her willingness to help with Jonah's goodbye, I was already planning a service for him that would involve all of his family and friends.  She immediately went on the defensive, and said that she had \"only started to plan a service when she realized I wasn't willing to do it in a timely manner\".  I told her that the timing wasn't her choice to make, but that if she wanted to have a memorial of some kind, to please just add on the invitation that his \"official\" memorial was going to be held this weekend.  She said fine.\n\nI sent a message to all of Jonah's invited friends/family to make sure that they knew the real service with both of our families was going to be here, and then just washed my hands of the whole thing.  \n\nThis week I received a message on facebook from Jonah's cousin, saying that Marjorie (who has apparently blocked me on facebook) created an \"event\" for Jonah's \"official\" memorial service (her memorial) and invited everyone she possibly could.  I've been getting blown up with emails asking which day the memorial is, and where.  I'm honestly furious -- I don't have the emotional energy to deal with this.  \n\nI ended up putting a post up on my wall, reiterating the date of his service here, and asking people to please share it.  Thankfully I think the older members of the family don't use facebook or email very often, so most of them haven't been confused, but a lot of people now think that Marjorie's service is the real one.\n\nI called Marjorie again, asking her to add an addendum to her event saying that his actual memorial was going to be here.  She told me that \"Jonah would have wanted it this way\" and that \"if I couldn't appreciate her efforts, I wasn't invited to say goodbye to Jonah.\"  I told her that was fine, seeing as I'd already said goodbye to Jonah when I held him as he died.  She hung up.\n\nApparently she's now spreading information to her mutual friends with Jonah, saying that he was planning on leaving me because I wasn't able to conceive.  She also said that we had approached her to carry a baby for us -- all absolute lies.  His cousin sent me a screenshot of a text where she said that \"Jonah always thought we would have the cutest baby together\" and that \"AngryWidow doesn't understand how much he wants children\".\n\nI'm at a loss as to what to do.  I don't care what she says about me, but she's now tarnishing my husband's memory -- especially saying that he wanted to divorce.  Jonah would never have left me, and anyone that knows him at all knows that we were committed to each other above all else.\n\nI need to figure out how to tell this woman to fuck off without encouraging her to spread more lies.  And I also want to just forget the whole thing and crawl in bed and never get up again.\n\nHelp me, please.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My husband's former \"best friend\" is trying to plan his entire memorial service and is tarnishing his memory.

I was the only person he could communicate at work with ASL, even though I only could sign basic words. Later, he began to teach me in more advanced ASL and we found out we have so much in common in tv, movies, books tastes with similar goals and desires in life that we became best friends that evolved into a romantic relationship. We're going strong nine months now and we're compatible in every area. It's the best and healthiest relationship I ever had and I'm always excited and giddy to see him at work or when we wake up together. He feels the same and we're talking moving each other as soon his lease is up in three months from now.  \n\nTwo months ago, we decided to meet each other parents which all are hearing (he's their only deaf son). Alan met mine and it went fabulous. Then we met his parents, \"Irma\" and \"Paul\". \n\nI thought we got along because they were smiling, gushing and laughing but I'm beginning to believe they were putting their best masks for the sake of their son. One time on a family's bday parties, Irma said in front of the ladies with me next to her, \"It's so impressive you can talk with that speech impediment. I barely can understand you myself.\" She said as jokingly manner but no one laughed, everyone glanced at each other awkwardly and I just stared at her, then excused myself. At first I wasn't sure if she meant as generational-ignorant way like \"who's the woman in the relationship?\" to the gays. I didn't mention to my boyfriend because I was hoping it was only time remark.\n\nIt wasn't. They made more comments, mostly Irma, about me struggling pronunciation or grammars, using sign language incorrectly and not teaching me the right one like Alan would do, or not having deaf/HH friends or not going more to deaf community and so on. It happened so gradual and subtle that I didn't realize they were being insulting to my face that to this day I still wonder. Most of the time they would make those comments without Alan nearby. I mentioned to Alan few times and he told me that maybe they were worried I might not understand the deaf culture. He talked to them that saying those things weren't helpful and he would appreciate if they would shut it up. They didn't.  \n\nFew weeks ago at bbq party, Irma and Paul sort of insinuated about my parent for not giving best tool for me, saying it was a shame that my parent didn't put me in deaf school or letting me to get cochlea implant or letting me to study aboard in non-deaf university program. They made it sound as if my parent crippled me as person because my social and emotional network didn't consist the \"right\" people. This time I got angry and I said what they said was rude, that my parents made lot sacrifice for me and no one has the right to belittle for their choices about raising me. Alan caught at the end of the conversation (lipreading) and asked me what's going on. Not so surprisingly, Alan's parent threw me under the bus, remarking I was so sensitive after making such innocuous comment. Alan saw I was uncomfortable and asked me if I want to leave. I said yes and we left, when we got home he asked me what they said to me. I didn't want to say what his parent told me because it was so ugly to talk about it but I told him anyway and he got upset for me. He face-timed them and said they shouldn't said that. He told them they crossed the line. They pretended they didn't know what I was talking about, that perhaps I misunderstood, considering I'm \"hard hearing\" which upset Alan even more. They ended arguing for few minute before Alan hung up. \n\nSince then, Alan has become desolate and needy. He apologized to me hundred of times for not believing me what I said before. I told them that he has nothing to apologize because I wasn't sure if they were being snide toward me until now and I'm not going to blame Alan for what his parent said to me. He told me he's thinking reducing contact with them but I told Alan it wasn't necessary. He can do whatever he wants with his parent but that I rather would not go to any of his family gathering or go his parent's. He assured he would never force me or put me in that situation ever again. \n\nWe're closer together than we were but he's still sad and he no longer goes to his family gatherings or his parent's.

Most of the time they'll be rational at this point, but sometimes they won't, so I'll then ask more pointed questions.  \"Will being cold to my good friend bring back your furry friend?  Does making everyone else around more miserable make you feel better?\"  Typically I have about a 90% success rate with this dialog for deescalating tense situations.  \n\nSometimes people feel like the best way of showing how much they love their lost one is by being a dick to everyone.  My best guess is that they do it to demonstrate that they loved more than decorum allows, so by violating social rules and norms they can show themselves and others that this is the case.  Once they figure out why they are being a dick it usually settles down.  Good luck man.  Let us know how it turns out.\n\nEDIT: Oh one more thing.  REASON DOES NOT APPLY.  Forcing ultimatums will only give her a venue to further demonstrate how deeply she feels/loves whatever.  Grief makes people dumb.  I'm not justifying her behavior but man, if i had 2 bucks every time I experienced something like this in the face of loss I could pay off my student loans easily.   If you try to guide the logic of a grieving person you'll just come off as manipulative and she'll probably entrench herself deeper in the delusion.  You can't give them the obvious conclusions even though you totally want to. All you are trying to do is build up the idea that you know that they love the departed and you can't possibly feel as awful as she does because no one feels as deeply as she can (even though it's probably not true). ", "This sounds like it is more of an issue with your girlfriend's grief and her difficulty processing it. Losing a pet, especially one that still so young, is really sad and your girlfriend has a right to her feelings. What she doesn't have a right to is to control who you can and can't be friends with.

I told them I might just need some guidance.\n\nThey weren't that enthusiastic first, they were like \"we're really busy, we don't have time to teach a child how to cook.\" I told them its really important, and to help them understand the gravity of the situation, I told them I was proposing tonight.\n\nThey both went crazy and excited, like \"oh my God oh my God, have you bought a ring yet?\"  I showed them the ring, and my sister went flipping crazy, screaming, crying tears.  I told them I was probably going to ask for their opinion on it any way, and they were really enthralled and so excited and happy for me.

She kept telling my girlfriend how beautiful she looked tonight, how excited she was for her, how we were perfect for each other.  The way she was smiling and acting too excited really gave it all away, she said \"he's got something really really special planned for you.\"\n\nI kept trying to push her out the door and telling her to shut up, but she just wouldn't, and she kept chatting to my girlfriend. I wanted to push her out, by my girlfriend told me I was being rude to her, and I should let the talk.  I just sighed and knew it would end badly, but my sister kept being as unsubtle as possible, \"I really wish I could be a fly on the wall here tonight\" \"you are so so lucky\" \"if only you knew\".\n\nMy girlfriend was then \"is he going to propose?\" My sister didn't say yes or no, she just gritted her teeth in a big smile like \"mmmnnnnngghhhhh :) :) :) :) \"  I didn't even get a chance to say anything, and my girlfriend just started screaming and crying and hugging me suffocating me.  My mum was trying to pull my sister away, but she just started screaming \"SHOW HER THE RING! SHOW HER THE RING!\" I told her to seriously shut the fuck up, and that my mum was clearly waiting for her ,but she kept shouting \"show her the ring!\".  I tried to explain to them that this really wasn't the way I had planned it, I wanted to do it when we were alone and I had  a long speech planned.  They both just wanted to see the ring.  I said can I at least say the speech? My sister was like \"you should let him say it, its a really beautiful speech.\"  I started and I'd barely got two sentences in when she interrupted me and was like \"actually its too fucking long, you can say it later, just show her the ring.\"\n\nI wanted to wait until we were alone so I could say the speech and THEN show the ring, but they were both literally screaming at me to show them. I told my sister she'd already seen it, she said she wanted to see it again and my girlfriend told me I had to show it to her now. I showed them the ring again and they both started shouting and screaming, they literally both jumped on me and pinned me to the couch like a lion grappling a dying elephant, and ripped the ring from my hand like a lion tearing meat from its prey.  I told them to get off they were suffocating me, but they were both literally hugging me to death while screaming like hyenas into my ears. It was like WWE or something, it was unreal.  I tried to pull away but they were both just hugging and kissing me and screaming into my ears, clawing at me and the ring like rapid animals, squeezing and suffocating me; my mother did nothing to help, she just stood there laughing as I went down.\n\nI realised they were mainly interested in the ring so I let them have it and crawled away to the side of the couch where I could breath properly. I felt the evening was ruined already, I had nearly just been clawed to death, I didn't know if my clothes were ripped, my hair was completely messed up, I had both their lipsticks smudged on my face from their dual hyena attack, and my clothes were a complete mess now.  It was an infuriating mess of a situation and I felt gross.  I just sat quietly there for at least two hours while my mother, girlfriend, and sister sat together looking at the ring, talking and chatting amongst themselves and acting like I wasn't there.\n\nThe entire evening was ruined.  My mum and sister were meant to be going out for the night, they didn't even leave once and were there the entire time.  The food that \"I\" had made was getting cold.  I told them dinner was getting cold, they all said they weren't hungry, and just sat there looking at the ring, obsessing over it like they are freaking gollum or something.\n\nMe, the boyfriend, the groom, may have as well been invisible, they were all completely ignoring me, pretending like I wasn't there.  I had planned this perfect evening between my girlfriend and I were I could propose, I'd been preparing it for such a long time. It was completely hijacked by my mother and sister, my sister spoiled it, and didn't even feel bad about it.  Worst of all, my girlfriend didn't even seem to mind.\n\nI told her this wasn't the evening I had in mind, she didn't care, she was too excited about the fact we're finally engaged.  I didn't even get a chance to say my speech.  She was like \"don't worry you can say it tomorrow, I'm too tired now.\"  It really hurt my feelings, I don't think she understood how sad that made me feel.\n\nMy girlfriend didn't even seem to care that it wasn't even really me who proposed to her,and the way my sister was acting, you'd think like she was the one getting married.  This entire evenign I'd planned out for so long... I'd been entirely cut out of it. Sidelined. Reduced to a spectator.\n\nAfter we finally did have the dinner, I asked my girlfriend if we could spend some time together in bed before she goes back home for the night.  She was like \"we can't, your mum and sister are here, we can't just leave them.\"  I told her they weren't even meant to be here, they were meant to have gone out tonight, and they both were like \"yeah, yeah, go upstairs, don't worry about us.\" I told her she really shouldn't worry about them , we should both just go upstairs and spend some time together, she was like no, it would feel too weird and awkward.\n\nWell, that sucked so much. i felt like the entire night was ruined. I'd barely gotten anything out of it, I didn't even spend any time with my girlfriend.  My sister completely spoiled and ruined everything, the entire night was hijacked.\n\nI tried to explain to my girlfriend why everything that had happened, including her own behaviour and acceptance of it, really bothered me.  She didn't seem to understand and just brushed it aside. I explained to my mum, and she sort of understood and was apologetic, but tried to dump most of the blame on my sister.  My sister was still in an excited giddy mood, I asked her what was wrong with her, she said nothing. I told her she'd ruined the entire night and she acted like a 12 year old or a clown, she got offended and denied it.  She refused to see what she'd done wrong and how she'd ruined everything.  I don't undersetand her behaviour at all or why she would even act that way.\n\nBasically, I'm kind of hurt and offended by everything that's happened and the way they reacted to it.  Do I have the right to feel this way? Should I just let it go and move on or is there something I can do so that my grievances don't go unaddressed and ignored?\n\n**TLDR: planned a magical evening with my girlfriend (of six years) to propose to her.  My sister and mother spilled the beans on everything, hijacked it, and ruined the entire night.  Everyone completely ignored me when it was supposed to be a night of my girlfriend and I.  Nobody acts like they did anything wrong, they all think it was perfectly fine and brush aside it when I try to explain how hurt I am by what they all did and how I didn't like being basically pushed to the side, ignored for hours, and ruining all my plans. Am I right to feel this way? What should I do about it?**\n\nedit: spelling corrections"}, {"comments": ["My advice: Be honest but tactful, and focus on the impact to your work.

The only thing that worked was to say \"hey, I'm in a meeting right now, we'll talk later,\" like a stuck record every time he tried asking a question or saying it would only take a second or whatever.\n\nI think what I would do at this point is set up a regular meeting slot with her- daily, weekly, every other day, w/e- and then turn down any meeting requests outside of it. If she keeps asking to meet, just tell her your next meeting with her is on [DATE].\n\nIf she asks questions, ask what she thinks she should do (quickest way I've found to redirect stuff like this!)

I like my job and most everyone I work with, bar one member of the senior team I'll call Gavin \\[40M\\]. Gavin isn't the top of the food chain but he has a lot of clout, as the CEO really likes him and handpicked him to join the company based on their past relationship.\n\nMost of the people at my company have worked with each other before in past roles or know each other personally. Hiring friends is the norm, though I'm one of the few \"outsiders\". This hasn't been an issue at all up until recently, when Gavin hired his wife Donna \\[F39\\] to work part time at the company and asked her to work on some of my projects without consulting me first. I only found out she was going to share projects with me on the day she started.\n\nUnfortunately, Donna is not experienced nor naturally talented in the work she's been assigned. She's been insecure, needy and anxious from day one, and lacks the basic skills necessary to do her job well. I've tried to help her adjust because I would actually welcome some help with my workload, but she pulls me into meetings for an hour or two every time she's in the office, asking me really basic questions and/or just quietly panicking at me. She also does this with CEO, who she knows personally through Gavin.\n\nI've tried to pull away a little bit by not responding instantly to her Slack messages and not accepting every meeting she's tried to book with me. The result has been that she's started interrupting me in meetings, asking basic but usually inappropriate questions addressed to me. I don't think she's intentionally undermining me because she's always grateful when I 'help' her but I'm finding it hard to stay patient. Gavin, of course, always chimes in to support her in team settings.\n\nI've also tried to build my 1:1 relationship with Donna so there's enough trust to establish boundaries, but unfortunately I can't really find much common ground with her. She's quite negative, complaining loudly that no one at the company has their shit together and I feel like she probably says the same things about me to her husband and the CEO outside the office.\n\nThere are very subtle signs that the CEO may be starting to realise hiring her wasn't a great idea - if she wasn't Gavin's wife I think she'd definitely be on her way out, so I think my best strategy here is to wait this out and try to stay calm. However, the CEO booked a 1:1 with me next week and if he asks me about Donna I'm not sure what I'll say. I feel the resentment growing, not just at Gavin and Donna, but also at the CEO for not establishing a fair work environment.\n\nI don't want to ruin my place in the company over this. My question is, how do I handle Donna while covering my own ass? And what should I say if asked about what I think of Donna's work?\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*: Whoa, this blew up. Thanks all for your comments and advice - I just read everything. To clarify a few things:\n\n1. Donna isn't my direct report. We don't have managers at our company, so technically no one is. I wasn't asked to train her, but when I found out on her first day she'd been told to \"support\" some of my projects I sort of had to step in.\n2. I don't know if the CEO is going to talk about Donna in our meeting, but I don't like being caught off guard so I'm thinking more 'what if?'\n3. She doesn't have a JD or even a title, so I understand her anxiety to some extent as our environment is pretty chaotic. Given her personal connections I told her she could probably just define her own role and give herself any title she wants, but she hasn't done it.\n4. I don't ignore her messages, I've just stopped responding \\*immediately\\* because it fucks up my focus\n5. I'm not the only person she's doing this to. She naturally also books Gavin into long meetings and also the CEO . She's the only one who gets this level of attention from the senior team in the company and it's not really sustainable in any case\n6. The work I've tried to help her do is still substandard, which is mainly what's worrying me, and she doesn't really have the right mindset for this type of business that I've seen. She might get away with it as just an average employee in a big company, but in this setting it's glaringly obvious.\n\nShe's made references a few times that she's been near quitting from stress, so I really don't want to get any more involved in this unless I have to. I don't want to get her fired. But her flailing around, taking up my time is indeed disruptive to my ability to get things done, especially right now because I have additional project work on top of my daily responsibilities. I would just talk to her but I'm afraid she'll take it totally the wrong way because she's so wound up, and I already have a not great relationship with her husband so I don't want any of that backsplash.\n\nI think my best case scenario is that the CEO takes over her coaching completely if he wants her to stay. I don't feel like I can really ask for that directly but maybe I could angle for it."}, {"comments": ["I've been in relationships with guys like this and I've been the guy like this (not for anxiety reasons, but similar enough), and as a stopgap in the moment, I really recommend agreeing on silence.

I'm 95% sure it's just the anxiety talking and you don't actually believe this, but from now on I'm going to start saying these things only once per conversation.

Don't do this. At least not if you are trying to pretend like everything is okay. You are in trauma and processing a lot of things. There is going to be shame and embarrassment.\n\nStep 1: take screenshots of everything between them. If you tell them, they might try to deny it, erase the evidence and call you crazy.\n\nStep 2: take back your holiday. Seriously, fuck trying to keep the peace. Tell your parents that your sister is fucking your fiance and that you will not spend Christmas with either of them. Offer screenshot proof. Make alternate plans for christmas at a friend's house.\n\nHold a boundary that you will not be around either of them. You will be 10 x more miserable if you try to hold out and have this fight after Christmas. You didn't ruin the holidays, they did.", "To start with if this is 100% what is happening. End it. That level of deceit, dishonesty and disregard for your feelings is not acceptable in any way no matter the time together.    \n    \nSecondly, start thinking practically. Screenshots, take them and save them to a flash drive. Images, messages, all of it. It will be hart to look at but do it. You need proof, you may not think it but you will. Financially. This is hard I know. Chanel that hurt your feeling and make it cold as ice. I assume you\u2019re living together and share some items. What you need to do around those needs to be decided and doing so in advance will save issues later down the line.    \n    \nThird, make a decision. Can you handle that at your family home for x-mas?\n", "First of all, I am so sorry this has happened to you. What your fiance and sister have done is inexcusable, hurtful and morally repugnant. I know this pain is intense, but thank your lucky stars that you have discovered the truth. No longer do you have to waste anymore time (and a marriage no less) on your soon-to-be ex nor do you have to nurture a relationship with a spiteful sibling. You're about to lose some dead weight; you are about to cut out two very hurtful and deceitful people from your life. \n\nIn regards to your relationship, you know what you need to do. You must end it. Someone who would lie and cheat on you has no love or respect for you. This creep not only cheated, but also embarked on this ugly escapade with someone he knew you were close to: your sister. He chose to hurt you, play you and then pursue a future with you all while screwing around with your sibling. This is unforgivable behavior and reveals how completely selfish and manipulative your fiance is. Cut off this engagement as soon as possible then completely block this guy from all your social media. He isn't the loving caring man you thought he was. He is a liar; he is jerk. \n\nBefore you break up with this man, take the other advice given here and gather evidence. Get a thumb drive and transfer all screen shots of dirty pictures, facebook messages and any videos onto it. Yes, it will suck beyond belief to go through these images, but it will benefit you in the long run. It provides you with proof against the fiance and sister when they try to make excuses for their behavior, or straight up lie to you about it. Also, as awful as this sounds, if mom and dad don't believe you, well, you'll have the evidence of the affair to share with them. (Hopefully, it will not come to that). \n\nI also advise you to split up any joint bank accounts. Move all your assets into a private account that only you can touch. If you're sharing an apartment (which it sounds like you are) talk to your landlord about the lease agreement. I'd honestly move out in your shoes. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere near my cheating ex. If the majority of the lease is paid by you or in your name, then the ex fiance can go. This is really your call here. Either kick him out or relocate. Legal advice reddit will have more knowledge on this front. \n\nIn terms of Christmas, I would not be heading home to spend it with your sister. Once you have all your evidence, I think you should call or Skype your parents. Tell them everything. Let them know that you will not be doing anything with your sister for the foreseeable future. That what your sister has done has hurt you in an unimaginable way, and that it is your sister's responsibility to mend her relationship with you not yours. I'd even go as far as to say this, \"Mom and Dad, I would still love to spend Christmas with you guys, but if sister is going to be there then I will not be going.

I hope you both can understand and respect that.\" \n\nIf your parents try to say, \"No, sister would never do that\" then provide them with evidence. Don't allow yourself to be guilted into forgiving your sister or to attend a holiday where her very presence will cause you more heartbreak. You need to put yourself first now. I'm hoping your parents will be sensible and compassionate towards your situation. If they end up defending your sister, you should cut ties with them for awhile as well. You don't need anymore stress, pain or ugliness in your life right now. What you do need is time to heal. \n\nLastly, confront both the fiance and sister with all the things you have found. (Perhaps do this with a trusted friend or two around that will offer you support). Tell them you're through with both of them. If your sister begins to cry, let her. Remind her that she threw away her relationship with you to cheat with your fiance. She helped cause this rift and you, frankly, cannot trust her anymore. Also remind her that this isn't something sisters do to each other (let alone friends) and that you are going no contact for awhile. \n\nAs for the fiance, tell him you are done. Tell him you are either moving out or he is (this depends on the lease agreement and what you decide in regards to that). Then you know what you should do? Give him the engagement ring. Tell him marriage and love are things you find sacred, and you will not spend your life shackled to a liar that transformed those delicate sentiments into a mockery. You deserve better than him. After this, you can either leave with your things all packed or kick your sister and ex out of your apartment. Make sure if you keep said apartment that you also change the locks. You don't want either of them having a key either. \n\nWhen the dust settles, remind yourself you did nothing wrong. You were betrayed and cruelly so. Take all the time you need to heal. Travel. Pursue new hobbies. Hang out with friends. Make new friends. Maybe even consider some therapy too because what you've experienced would shake anyone up. You'll get through this OP. I know you will.

In them, it contains a ton of dirty texts, nudes, and messages to meet up. I was absolutely shocked when I saw this.

I know, I know, what kind of monster am I for not wanting to bring a little girl to the place where dreams come true?! Except Jane's family has already been to Disney World twice, most recently earlier this year in February. My cousin has done very well for herself - she runs a successful photography business, and her husband is an engineer. They are definitely able to afford their own vacations.

I also don't want to saddle my mother with the responsibility of caring for her. I've babysat Kelly before, but only for a few hours at a time. I'm not sure why my cousin is even comfortable with the idea of me taking her child three states away.  We are in North Carolina, so it's not like Orlando is just a short drive down the road if something happens. \n\n\nI tried telling Jane I'm not comfortable bringing Kelly, and she just said this is a good opportunity to find out what being a parent is like.

I really want to get good grades and it's not going to happen if I'm stretched completely thin.\n\n\nNot to mention that this current job I'm at is wearing down on me physically, mentally and emotionally:\n* I'm constantly being relied on far too much and given an extra work load for no benefit on my own because 99% of the people there don't work hard, don't show up and can't be fired (because they're desperate and need people)\n* I can't speak up about it or ask for a lighter load because the regional manager has already threatened people's jobs for working too slow\n* Due to the repetitive nature of the job, I'm already developing wrist and knee problems\n* The place is cloaked in dust and giving me severe allergy problems\n* There's no air conditioning and we're still expected to work hard, even during severe heatwaves\n* Constant micromanagement from a new manager that's pushing a lot of people to look for another job as wel\n\nSo this pushed me to find another job, which luckily, I landed and in 3 weeks time will start.

I hope we can work together on this to make sure she does the necessary work.\n\nMy daughter and I both understood the goal of this assignment to be to research and learn about her family's culture. [Reference the exact wording on the assignment.] Is this correct? \n\nOur family's culture is not tied to our country of origin. Although this is somewhat unique among those of us of European descent, our family's cultural identity is Jewish. The Jewish identity is not only a religion, and culturally distinct from any individual country, even Israel. I know this can be confusing for people not already familiar with it. I'd be happy to discuss it further with you and answer any questions you may have. This is why my daughter turned in an assignment showing her research on this cultural group, and not a country. As far as the assignment was communicated with me, I believe my daughter's work fulfills the basic requirement.\n\nMy daughter has told me that you have asked her to redo this assignment and research a specific country. Is that correct? Again, she and I understood that the assignment was about culture. [Reference the original wording?] Did you clarify this in person in class?\n\nIt looks to me like we have a misunderstanding related to the specific requirements of this assignment: culture or country. Of course, if the assignment handout said country, or you told the class in person that they had to research a country, my daughter and I misunderstood and she needs to redo the assignment. But if the assignment was to research her family's culture, than I respectfully assure you she has done exactly that and ask that you grade her work accordingly. It is both fair and necessary for her to redo the assignment if she misunderstood, but it is not fair for her to do more work because her family's culture is not tied to her country of origin.\n\nOr I wonder if it's possible that the assignment said culture, but maybe you have a learning outcome or curriculum requirement regarding researching countries that the class has to fulfill? In this case, I understand the need for her to meet that requirement. But as she completed the project as assigned, I don't believe it is fair to ask her to repeat her work. Is there a smaller supplementary assignment she might complete to fulfill the same objective?\n\nI hope you understand that I am not seeking special accommodations for my daughter. I'm looking to see if there is a misunderstanding at play that we can resolve without adding extra work to your plate or hers. Ultimately, she needs to fulfill the same educational objective as her peers.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on the subject.\n\nThanks,\n\nEtc.", "I think you're making the right decision here. I remember when I was in 4th grade I was assigned something similar and, since I was black, I couldn't point to any specific country as my nation of origin. Because of that my teacher tried to force me to identify one as if somehow I was just joking about not knowing which country my slave ancestors were stolen from.\nIt's not only a little insulting to try to cookie-cut a person, even less a child, into specific mold just to meet a nonessential learning/assignment benchmark, but it's also alienating. I remember other kids talking and getting excited about where their families came from while I had to confront the reality, at 11 years old, that I'd never know that kind of information or get excited about my ancestral language. \nLater confrontations revealed that my 4th grade teacher was more than a little racist, but it took my mom standing up for me publicly, for me to take pride in the mystery and struggle of my lineage. I'll always love her for that to be honest. I don't let people give me shit about the color of my skin TODAY because of the resolve my mother showed in that parent teacher meeting.\nSo I mean, I hope that helps?", "Why is everyone downvoting the OP? This is a perfectly legit reason to be annoyed with the teacher. I'm a former teacher, and if my instructions were not specific enough that was on me, not my students. The teacher should let the student turn in the assignment as is, and sharpen up her instructions for next year. Things like this are a learning experience for the teacher - it's not the student's fault. \n\nI would politely email the teacher (maybe CC the principal?) and say that the instructions weren't clear, your daughter put a lot of work into the assignment, and if she could turn it in as she had already done it. You can reference your Jewish ancestry and point out that like many other ethnic minorities, your people come from various countries (and Israel is not one of them). ", "Honestly, it sounds like the teacher gave unclear instructions and this situation is complicated by the Jewish diaspora.  If your daughter were to write about Israel, she'd have to write the country pre-diaspora, not as it exists now.  If you want to keep fighting this, just go above the teacher's head.  \n\nIf you really want to be a pain in the ass about it, redo the assignment and haul out ever shit thing Russia or Poland did to the Jewish people.  Point out how they weren't allowed to consider themselves real citizens the countries of and how they were othered and discriminated against for thousands of years.

How do you choose a country in Africa when you may not have any way of tracing your heritage there?  What if you are adopted?

Mrs. Jones told the students to write a report and do a presentation on their family ancestry and culture. Our family is from various Eastern European countries. However, we are Ashkenazi Jews, so we aren't the same as other people from Eastern Europe. Our ancestors spoke Yiddish first, and Polish/Russian/etc second, and had different customs. My daughter knows this, so she decided to write about Ashkenazi culture. For her poster, instead of drawing pictures of the countries we came from, she drew Eastern Europe with a Jewish star over it.\n\n\nAfter she turned it in, I got a message from her teacher that she would have to redo it! Apparently, the assignment was done incorrectly since it didn't focus on the particular countries in general. The assignment didn't say they needed to pick a country, it said they needed to write about their family's culture. I tried to explain to the teacher that doing a report on Poland or Russia didn't make sense since we weren't really Polish or Russian and didn't follow any customs, but she kept insisting that the report had to focus on the countries. She said that my daughter could do her report on Israel instead, if she wanted to focus on her Jewish heritage. That doesn't make sense either, since we can't trace our ancestry to Israel and don't follow any Israeli customs.\n\n\nI know this sounds like it's not that big of a deal, but I'm really annoyed at this teacher for being so stubborn. Sure, she could absolutely insist that my daughter write about Russia, Poland, and Romania in general, but the assignment was supposed to be about your own culture, not someone else's, so the assignment would be pointless.\n\n\nI'm trying to write a message to the teacher to explain clearly why my daughter's presentation fulfilled the assignment and should be accepted and graded fairly. I don't want to come off too strong, but I need her to understand why insisting on writing about these countries so generally isn't necessarily appropriate for ethnic minorities. \n\n\n**tl;dr**: My daughter's teacher insists that her project on our family culture was done incorrectly."}, {"comments": ["Thank her, open it, stop worrying.

Longtime lurker here, and now it's my turn to post about my conundrum and get outside opinions. I'm really at a loss at to what I need to do. This is really, really long, so apologies in advance. \n\nMy husband and I have been together four years, married for one. Before we met I went to cosmetology school and I loved to express my style by coloring my hair bright colors, wearing dramatic makeup, and stretching my lobes. I enjoyed those things for a few years, and then I outgrew them. I still appreciate such things on others, but my personal style is more conservative now. I've always dressed somewhat modestly, because I don't like showing a lot of skin in public, so it's not like I used to wear daisy Dukes and now I wear burlap sacks. But my hair color is much more \"natural\" these days, my makeup is classic instead of dramatic, and I let my lobes close up. My workplace is quite conservative, so my red lipstick and heels is already pushing the envelope a bit. \n\nMy husband has always known that I used to look edgier than I do now, but I've never dressed like that since we've been together. He's said in the past that he wishes I still had blue hair or stretched lobes, but its always been understood that I no longer want to do those things, and that I would most certainly be fired if I came into work with blue hair. Or at least I thought that was understood. \n\nI came home two weeks ago to find him looking at some pictures that one of my old friends had posted and tagged me in on FB, and I was in several of the pictures, blue hair and all. He started saying how hot it was, and how he wished I looked like that. He said it would be more exciting and that he had always had a kink for girls with edgier style. Ok, I can work with that! I bought some colored clip ins and surprised him a few nights later. I went all out: colored hair, black thigh highs, cute little panties with skulls on them, and a tight baby doll tee that he's always liked. At first I thought he was really into it, but after we had sex he said that he thought the \"trial run\" had gone well, and now I should commit to an edgier style. I explained that I didn't want to dress like I used to, that I enjoyed doing it in the privacy of our home, but I wasn't going to wear fishnets and combat boots to the grocery store. He got quiet and asked why I wouldn't do this for him. I said that I wasn't trying to hurt his feelings, and that I was more than happy to dress up for him for sex or a date. I just am not going to bleach and color my hair or stretch my lobes again. \n\nHe stayed quiet for the rest of the night, and refused to discuss it with me any further. He ended up getting up and sleeping on the couch, and had already left when I got up for work. That evening he came home after work and said that he'd done some thinking, and he'd thought of a compromise. He wants me to to get my clit pierced, because that way I'll be \"edgy\" but it won't be hard to cover like stretched lobes or bright hair. I considered it while I fixed supper, and later than night I said that I would probably be ok with getting my nipples pierced, but that I wasn't comfortable with a genital piercing. I've never been intimate with another person, and the idea of someone else seeing and touching my vulva/clit is very uncomfortable for me. I don't think it would bother me as much if it was my breasts, and if nipple piercings would make me husband happy, I would be willing to try. He blew up and said that I was boring and plain, and why couldn't I just give him what he wanted? He said that he had always hoped that I would regain my old style, but that he was becoming disappointed because I still hadn't after four years. He went on and on about how boring I am and how a wife who wanted to keep her husband satisfied would agree to a clit piercing if that's what he wanted. He said that he wants to use me and make me cry and see my makeup run down my face. He said that regular anal and PIV isn't enough anymore, and that my blowjobs are terrible because I don't want to deepthroat him or be facefucked. He kept going and going, shouting at me and turning bright red. I started crying because I was hurt and humiliated, and he told me to shut up. Then he left for two days and wouldn't answer his phone. When he came back he started giving me the silent treatment and sleeping in the guest room. \n\nHe seems to think that I was a different person back in those days. I wasn't. I wasn't promiscuous or \"easy\". For pete's sake, I was a virgin when we started dating! And I'm not withholding or cold sexually. I'm willing to try almost anything once. We have anal sex once or twice a week, PIV six or seven times a week, and he gets a few blowjobs a week. We've tried light bondage, spanking, and role play. The only things we've tried that I don't like is face fucking and facials. Both feel very degrading and humiliating. I'm not sure if it's just the act itself, or if it's the way my husband treats me during and after these acts, but I don't enjoy them. He got very upset when I told him this, but he hasn't asked about doing those acts in a few months, with the exception of mentioning it during his rant about clit piercings. He wasn't willing to try cuddling afterwards, or talking to me affectionately during, he just quit mentioning it altogether. \n\nIt's been days since the piercing discussion, and he hadn't mentioned sex once. He's barely speaking to me. He's been leaving his computer on with pictures and videos of heavily pierced and tattooed porn stars getting facefucked or roughly anally penetrated, but he won't speak to me. I don't know what to do. Do I leave? Should I ask him to leave? It seems so silly to leave him over something as insignificant as a clit piercing, but he really hurt me when he yelled and called me boring. \n\nTL;DR: Husband wants me to dress edgier, and when I said I didn't want to dress like that all the time, he suggested I get my clit pierced. I said no because I'm not comfortable with it. He called me boring and said that he wants to use my body and make me cry. Now he's giving me the cold shoulder and sleeps in another room.

We met years ago online and have talked almost daily to what is approaching a decade. We have both flown back and forth once or twice a year to see the other and hang out, and we\u2019ve always been their for each other\u2019s big moments. \n\nShe found out last year that she is expecting her first child, and it was amazing news for us all, I was so happy for her to start the family I know she\u2019s always wanted with her husband [31M]. She came to visit a few months into her pregnancy and asked me to be the baby\u2019s godmother - I was over the moon. \nWhile we live an 8 hour plane ride from each other, I do have a job that gives me decent vacation allowance and deals with certain airlines that makes visiting manageable. I knew that I could be there for her, and told her that whenever she was ready for someone outside of the family to be there, I would make the trip. \n\n\nLast month, she had her baby shower, and I only found out when I saw on Instagram a mutual friend [28F] who lives in the same city as me, had surprised her at the shower. I hadn\u2019t been invited. I was a little hurt, and surprised, but it was the busiest month of the year for the company I work for, and I knew she knew that, so I figured that could be the reason, sent my gift by airmail and said congratulations. \n\nHowever now she\u2019s reached out to me, and told me that she has asked another friend (the same person who went to the baby shower) to be the baby\u2019s godmother, and that she only wants her child to have one. I felt like I\u2019d been punched in the gut. I was heartbroken, and felt a bit betrayed, for 6 months I have been excited to take on the role - my own godmother lives in New Zealand, and has done for most of my life, so I knew it could work.m, knew how to stay in contact and be a part of the child\u2019s life while living in another country. But now she\u2019s taken back her offer, and chosen someone else.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be so upset if she had chosen someone who lived closer, but she has replaced me with someone who lives in the same city as me, so it\u2019s not a distance thing. We have been friends for years, I have been there with updates, support and love her whole pregnancy, and at no point was there any clue she had changed her mind... until the baby shower a few weeks ago. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should confront her, tell her I\u2019m hurt, or just accept her decision, it\u2019s her baby, and I would never want to force her into a decision she wasn\u2019t happy with. I just don\u2019t know what to do or say to her now. I want to let her know I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m missing out, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m whining, and I want to know why she changed her mind, but I\u2019m scared the answer will just upset me.

And you should be able to be how you are (an adult who doesn't need any toxic people in her life) without any consequence to you. Don't get into arguments or discussions with anyone about it. This is how you are. Shrug. \n\nThat said, it's unfair to your mom to make her spend more money than she expected on no notice. So I would still give her the money. You don't need to punish your mom. But certainly you're not obligated to plan your sister's shower or to show up to it. \n\nAnd going forward, your husband is right. "], "edited": true, "id": "4lpati", "body": "My mom and my MIL threw me a surprise baby shower on Sunday and invited all of my family and most of my friends who are in my hometown. It was great, I don't usually get to see everyone when I visit so it was really nice to have them all there. My sister is also pregnant, she is 34 weeks and I am 36 weeks. My mom and I have been planning her baby shower with her that will be two weeks from now. \n\n\nAt the shower, everyone kept complimenting me on how tiny I am and how good I look and I could see my sister was getting really jealous. It was really upsetting her so I tried to change the topic but after the first little bit she retreated to a table in the corner with her friend looking incredibly angry. I tried to ignore it and we started playing shower games. Later, her friend asked if any of us knew where she was since she hadn't seen her in a while. Everyone was extremely worried because she wasn't answering her phone and we thought she could have gone into labor or fallen or something terrible. The shower was in a party room at an arena so it's a huge building and everyone there (~70 of us) began searching the entire place up and down looking for her. Many people got into their cars to drive around the area and the different routes to the hospital to see if they saw her car. We also called her husband to see if he had heard from her and he left work to help look. \n\n\nMy other sister found her sulking inside a timmies. She refused to come back to the shower because she was upset that she wasn't getting any attention and everyone was fawning over me. It took a while for everyone who left to get back and while we tried to carry on with the shower, the whole mood was soured and it was really awkward.\n\n\nI'm so upset with her now. I suspect once the baby comes I won't go down to my hometown as much and I won't get to see many of those people as often as I did before, so that was my last chance to get together with everyone before the baby. It's not even the first time she's done something like this. At my wedding she complained to anyone who was willing to listen about how my husband is very touchy-feely with me. And now whenever he touches me in any way in front of her she'll grumble and roll her eyes like she is upset that he is attracted to me or something. He dropped me off at the shower and when we were talking to friends he was standing behind me holding my belly and she said \"that's disgusting\" and made a gagging noise. She also won't show up to something unless someone has called her to ask where she is and tell her were waiting for her, it's a little game that she likes to play. I don't know what her problem is but I'm so sick of it. \n\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since the incident and won't return my calls or texts but I think she owes me an apology. If she can't apologize I don't think I want to continue to plan and pay for her baby shower. Is that fair? My mom and my aunt think I just need to try to move past it because \"that's just how she is.\" My husband feels differently and he thinks I should stop doing anything for her because she continuously disrespects* us and our marriage. \n\n\n**tl;dr**: My very pregnant sister left my baby shower without telling anyone which made everyone worry and go searching for her, only to find her sulking because she wasn't getting attention. She won't talk to me now and I think she should apologize or I will stop paying for and planning her shower but my mom says that's unfair. "}, {"comments": ["\nI think you need to tell your wife that she needs to step up more in the home if you are going to take care of these kids. \n\nAlso she needs to learn to cook, man! She's 33 and only working part time. There's no reason for her to not spend some time cleaning the house and doing some cooking. Lots of cooking is EASY and she can look up youtube videos. Shit, I'm 28 and just learned a better way to chop up onions and I eat onions like every damn day. \n\n Of course she doesn't mind the idea of taking on two more kids because so far she has it easy peasy with the three kids you already have. That's cool that she's a great mother, but you guys need to set up a real system that she needs to follow to help take some of the pressure off of you even if you DON'T end up taking care of these other kids.\n\nThink about the ideal situation here in your mind - even if your wife suddenly cooked dinner every night and kept the house clean, would you be willing to take on two more kids, or no? \n\nIt's okay to say no. This is a huge responsibility. \n\nBut if you do say yes, you have to have had a very in-depth conversation with your wife about your expectations of her first. \n\n", "A few thoughts which you may want to consider...\n\n1.  Your sister lost custody, your in-laws were granted guardianship.  So first, consult an attorney for the exact details... but if you take over guardianship of the girls via the foster system - you'd get paid by the state for their care.  \n\n2.  With the additional burden of two dependents, you may yourselves qualify for state aid like food stamps - thus freeing up a bit of cash for other necessities.\n\n3.  Get on Craigslist, in the \"Services > Household\" section, and hire yourself someone to come in and clean weekly.  These people offer their services for between $15-20/hour, and a decent one should be able to have your home sparkling in 3-4 hours.  \n\n4.  If you go through the system to take in your nieces, you'd also probably qualify for respite care.  That's where the girls go visit another foster family on some weekends... which would give you free time to relax, focus on just your three, etc.\n\n5.  Your kids aren't doing enough chores.  I tell you this as a mother who raised three kids... your kids aren't doing enough chores.  Every one of them should have a bunch of chores, even the youngest.  If you look online, there are an absolute TON of sites with lists of age-appropriate chores - USE THEM.\n\n6.  Stop making dinner when you come home from work.  There are hundreds of sites online that show you how to spend ONE DAY A MONTH prepping meals for an entire month's worth of dinners... and tons of those meals are crock-pot meals, where you dump them out of a freezer bag and into the crock pot before you leave for work in the morning, and you have a delicious dinner ready when you get home.  Cooking this way is cheaper, easier, and less stressful than whatever you are currently doing, GUARANTEED.  Your wife is probably smart enough to handle doing the actual grocery shopping for your \"day of cooking,\" so give her that part.  And get that woman involved in couponing.\n\nFinally... you're in a panic, because this is all so overwhelming.  Stop and take a breath.  Take another.  Now... stop REacting, and begin **researching** the things I've talked about here.  This situation isn't some insurmountable tragedy you can't handle... not when you step back and start looking at it through logic instead of emotion.  You have the tools to make this work - you've just got to realize it.\n\n", "No matter what you decide, your wife NEEDS to learn basic cleaning and cooking skills.  It's not rocket science.

A few months before we met, James brought a brand new home in a newer subdivision. We recently refinanced it and added my name.\n \nBefore me, James dated a woman, Britt, for about 7 months (she\u2019s never been to this current house). From what he\u2019s told me, they broke up when he decided they weren\u2019t as compatible. The breakup was rough- to the point where he and neighbors called the police when she wouldn\u2019t leave his front yard and was screaming at 10 pm at night. This is all from what he and his sister have told me. I don\u2019t have a reason to not believe them. I\u2019ve only had a few run-ins with Britt. These have been at restaurants or just coincidences out in public. We never spoke up until now.\n \nThe problem:\n \nBritt has bought a house in the same subdivision that we live in. We even share a cul-de-sac. The only reason we found out about this is from a flyer we got welcoming her to the neighborhood (our subdivision is very \u201ccommunity\u201d oriented). James insists he\u2019s never told her where he lives and hasn\u2019t spoken to her since the night he called the police.  We both brushed it off as a coincidence but lately it\u2019s becoming very weird.\n \nHere\u2019s why:\n \n-I work for a company that allows me to work from home 3 out of the 5 days. Our home is a ranch and my office window faces the street. I\u2019m not sure what Britt does for a living but she does not work during the day. From about noon until 3, she spends her time walking up and down our street. When she passes our house, she doesn\u2019t take her eyes off of it. It\u2019s almost like she can see me in the office. She\u2019ll even stop in front of our house and stretch there for about 5 minutes. Every day anyone is at home. It makes me uncomfortable to the point where I have all of our blinds closed during the day. I understand the need for exercise but she walks for 3 hours just going up and down our street.\n \n-Another issue is when either James or I are outside with the dog, she\u2019ll let her dog outside and it will come sprinting to our yard. This causes her to come and get her dog. Every time she says \u201cI\u2019m sorry, were still working on training.\u201d James and I are always polite. Normally, I would be ok with this but James has pointed out that any other time she lets her dog out and we\u2019re not outside, she\u2019ll immediately correct him before he runs off. She never corrects him when we\u2019re outside.\n \n-We\u2019ve been getting \u201cding dong ditched\u201d a lot since she\u2019s moved in. Something that\u2019s NEVER happened in the 4 years that James owned the house. The doorbell will ring around dinner time (between 6 and 8) and by the time anyone gets to the door, no one will be there. It\u2019s gotten to the point where our Doberman has picked up the routine and waits by the front door, pacing.  \n \n-The last issue, which I believe might be illegal, is that our mail seems to go missing for a while and then pop back up. What I mean is, Britt will knock on our door and say that she received our mail and is just returning it. This has NEVER happened with the previous owners in her house. We don\u2019t have a new mail carrier either. It seems to happen once a week and she\u2019ll always bring it on a Friday night. Based on the date on the envelopes, we can tell she\u2019s been holding it all week. This has pushed James over the edge because she had our water bill which resulted in us being 2 days late on the payment (James is neurotic when it comes to paying bills). Every time I have to convince him not to go over and yell at her because we haven\u2019t actually caught her taking it out of our mailbox as much as I try to monitor it. She usually gets two days-worth of mail because those are the days I\u2019m not working from home, the other days I get it right away.\n \nI\u2019m not sure what to do at this point.  I don\u2019t want to piss her off by confronting her but how can I get her to stop? She\u2019s making us nervous and I feel uncomfortable in my own yard most of the time because I know she is watching.\n \nAny advice? I know this sounds strange but I\u2019m not sure if I can legally do anything about it. I don\u2019t have anything against her; it\u2019s just becoming an annoyance.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My fianc\u00e9s ex girlfriend recently moved in across the street.

All it took was 20 weeks in ICU (broken over three years), a colostomy bag, nearly losing not one, but both of her hands, staph infections, removal of bone, nearly dying several times, I kidnapped her, all the methadone, smuggling suboxone, you name it and finally, after having every single person finally turn their backs on her - including me, the final hold out. After shutting the door for a year, she started crawling out, without my help.\n\nShe became very motivated last year and knew of a way to get herself off the street. She got knocked up, out of desperation. Suddenly, she had a bed in a rehab facility. Suddenly, she had benefits. Suddenly, she had all of these doors flying open. I was still amazed she managed to conceive. \n\nAnd she is really, actually doing it. I haven't had to enable her in any way. We live in Colorado, she doesn't even mess with dabbling in weed anymore, and she is a drug addict straight out of a textbook. \n\nShe fears homelessness more than she fears withdrawal. That's what it seems like it came down to. Its that fear that keeps it going. For her it seems like she had to fear something more, but it didn't become the homelessness and poverty until something more important than her was at stake.\n\nThat sounds positive, and it is, in its way. She still has a struggle ahead as a single mom, but for the first time in 15 years I believe she's clean. I don't check on her, she's been solid as a rock for over a year now. She doesn't lie, shes punctual (probably the biggest tell), and she's fat. The fetus seems healthy, she's due new years.\n\nBut the overall cost, the emotional cost, all that trauma, all the hospital nights, the lying. There were times when I begged her, while she lay unconscious and intubated in front of me, not to come back. I would tell her, after a decade of dealing with her addiction, that it was OK if she quit this time. I would understand. I promised her I would be really sad and it would be really hard, but going through this every year was just too hard anymore. I begged her to just stay asleep. \n\nI would have been happy with her at peace. It is just a motherfucker of an illness. I probably understand it better than anyone who has never tried it, and I don't really know how to convey it. I know my sister. I know she is in such a tiny set of the population of opiate addicts who get to recover, and so does she.\n\nI used to write about it a lot under a different moniker, but she still has a ways to go. She's on the methadone replacement still, the child will be born an addict. We will have to work with doctors to help the baby kick the single worst opioid out there. Hopefully we get it over with early. I do not have kids, but I do have a lot of infant experience.\n\nShe doesn't live with me and I will still never let her into my life in that way. She lives in a private, sober living residence for homeless, single mothers, where she can stay until the baby is 3 months old, then she is out on her own. Her completion of a previous program for pregnant mothers as well as her participation in a study with CU is helping with housing (think section 8) for a couple of years and other odds and ends. That's all privately funded, there's tons of support out there for single mothers, it turns out. \n\nIts an outcome. I do not have expectations of smooth skies ahead, that will maybe never exist, but at least she will have a healthy child at this point. \n\nPlease get your son to see someone. If yes young with no drug experience, get him a proper, fact based education in the topic. This can't continue to be about the scary boogey man heroin, the most evil drug ever. It isn't about that. Its about education and getting them to make responsible decisions, not using scare tactics. She's a walking scare tactic - her arms are visibly half missing - and that isn't enough to scare kids she's met.\n\nIm sorry, this is wordy. Having lived with this with two of my siblings, as well as the suicide of my 22 year old brother, in a certain light I hear where they were or would be coming from. \n\nIt really is peace. I've seen this every way. It is devastating but it does get easier. It will always hurt, but it will get better. I really hate that anyone has to go through this, no matter how long or short. \n\nThe people who are attracted to opiates tend to be the sweeter, kinder, more sensitive ones.

We all cried for a long time and aired out a lot of feelings, and I was forgiven. Then, we all agreed to have a family intervention for our daughter. The deal was that she either goes to treatment or she doesn't get to stay in the home. My daughter was oddly unemotional during the meeting despite our pleas and crying, but she agreed to go to another treatment center about 200 miles away from home. We expected her to return today. \n\nBut our lives changed about 40 days after we dropped her off. We received a call from the police department near the treatment center, and they told us that a young woman was found hanging in a motel that morning.

Are you interested?\" A vacation to another country is a lot different to an outing or a day trip, and if it came across like you didn't really care whether he was there or not it could seem pretty hurtful.

It's not something that I've ever faulted him for or been mad at him about. We've never gotten in fights about it til now and it's something he told me upfront when we had first gotten in the relationship 4 years ago. \"I'm never going to be the kind of person that likes to go out a lot, I just want to hang out at home\" and I of course said that it was fine because that's not a flaw to me, it's just a character trait. \n\n\nI used to suffer from depression due to a lot of traumas in my life. I found it really hard to go outside at all, and especially alone. I missed out on a lot of experiences because of this. In our first year of dating, he got me to have more confidence in myself so I stopped hiding. I got a therapist and have been on a wonderful little antidepressant. We got married one year later and I'm still happier than I have ever been, and I'm incredibly grateful to have him in my life. That hasn't changed one bit.\n\n\nNow, I know that this isn't want he does. I know that he doesn't stay inside because he's depressed, it's because it's in his nature to be a housecat. And like I said, I'm still fine with that. Lately he's not okay with me doing this, though. \n\n\nIf I ask him if he wants to see a movie with me and he said \"no\" or the more common, \"I don't know, maybe\" I'll usually ask him two more times and then if he still says no or \"maybe\" I'll go by myself. It's the same with going out to dinner, taking little classes, etc. We had fun with this at first. I would come home from doing the thing and then I would excitedly tell him what I'd done and the people I'd met. He'd happily listen and hug me and kiss me on the forehead. It was a really beautiful thing. At one point we called it \"my little adventures\" and I would take polaroid pictures and show them to him and then hang them on the kitchen wall. It was a seriously beautiful point in our relationship and the times that we would go out and take polaroids together were some of the happiest times in my life. I even made it a point to have us do / go to things that *he* liked to do. It was great. It was seriously so great.\n\n\nAbout two years ago I asked him, \"Hey, I've been really passionate about learning a language and eventually going to this languages place of origin. Do you want to study it with me and then go there too?\" and he said no to the language, but maybe to going with me. \n\n\nCut to now and I'm pretty damn good at this language. I decided about four months ago that I am going to this place. I asked him and he would still like to come with me and he said no and got kind of upset that I had learned this language without him. \"You're the one that's going to know anything, there's really no point in me going.\" I was kind of taken aback because during the process he was really supportive. I didn't really push it, but I apologized and went somewhere else to clear my head about things and we were fine later on that day. I bought the tickets for me and my mother to go \"the place\" about four weeks ago and ever since then, things have been really tense. If I ask him to do minor things, like come to the grocery store with me, he gets a bit of an attitude. I can tell that he knows this is ridiculous though, because he'll say sorry almost immediately and be sad and quiet the rest of the time.\n\n\nI've tried to talk to him about what's bothering him, but he keeps either saying that it's nothing and he doesn't want to talk about it, or will tell me not to press it and then get mad and leave. I don't know what to do at this point. Our relationship has been so great, but I can feel things being strained. I can feel him kind of slipping away. I don't know what to do. I thought about buying him a ticket to \"the place\" anyway and surprising him, because I really would love it if he could go with me and I know for a fact it's somewhere he's always been interested in. But I also don't want to force him, because I hate forcing people to do things. However, I also don't want to do stop having these experiences for myself just because he doesn't want to. I've never faulted him for wanting to be at home, so why is he faulting me for wanting to be outside? I don't know how to talk to him or what to say. If I have to stop doing things, then... I guess I will? But I also feel bad for having to stop, but it's not worth getting a divorce over or having things escalate that bad. I just don't know what to do or where to go from here.\n\n**Edit/Update:** Hi! Um, we had a bit of a long talk. I'm kind of a mix of exhausted / drained / excited now so I apologize if I make a lot of typos or word something wrong. In a kind of big nutshell: He said he feels like he's drowning in my success. I said I would learn a language and I did it. I said I would lose 180lbs and I did it earlier in our relationship and got the skin surgery. I have a pretty stress free job and it's getting to him. He's been trying really hard to just be happy but it's hard. He understands that it's wrong to feel this way and between feeling guilty about it and feeling this way at all, it's just been taking its toll. He also has a skin condition that makes him feel cautious of going outside, especially in another country. :( I never thought this would be the problem, because he's always acted as though it's not a bother to him at all and he doesn't care.  He's going to keep trying though, and to seek therapy independent of me because he thinks that he also may really be suffering from depression.\n\n\nNow, I have to say that we *do* have communication problems. Our friendship (two years before dating) started off long distance in an mmorpg so we're still kind of better with text-talking than outloud speaking. Sometimes we have a hard time saying when things are bothering us out loud, so we'll text it out and then read off of that text because we find it hard to verbalise and sometimes we just take things harder than we should. We've agreed to go to marriage counselling and we're making an appointment together tomorrow, so there are good things afoot.\n\nFor more good news: He's agreed to go on vacation with me and my mother!\n\nAlso, I just want to say thank you to every single person who commented. It means a lot that people would wish us good luck and give advice and even say they were going to pray. Thank you for all of the advice! I'm trying to go down and thank everyone one-by-one but it might take a while, and in case I can't... thank you for helping save us.  \n\n**Uh, edit to the edit!** I would also like to add that I messed up in this, too. I liked to think that hearing maybe / other apathetic answers instead of just yes or no didn't bother me, but it did. And sometimes, as some people pointed out, I would get kind of passive aggressive about it. I'd ask him simply because it meant that I tried at times. I'm not proud of it, but it happened. I'm going to work on that more and myself as well. \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I've started going places and doing things without my husband because he's a housecat kind of guy.

My fianc\u00e9e and I have been dating for two years, and engaged for three months. She works in corporate strategy at a big company. Neither of us make a lot of money, we live in a tiny 1 BR/BA.\n\nRecently, one of our friends [27F] started selling jewelry and other little handmade trinkets via an online store (Etsy). It's going well, she's selling about one thing a day and making a bit of money on the side.\n\nI'm pretty sure my fianc\u00e9e got envious. She's artsy at heart, and often looked for a side-gig. After our friend started selling crafts, my fianc\u00e9e tried her hand at a number of things -- jewelry, pottery, etc. until she settled on paper flowers.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e has made _thousands_ of paper flowers over the past two months. \n\nShe's been trying to sell them online, and has gotten some success -- selling a few dollars' worth every day. That wasn't enough though, so she's also been selling them at markets, fairs, and plainly on the streets after work. \n\nHowever, the paper flowers don't make much money. Though we're not \"well off\" by any means, she still makes more money at her day job. \n\nBut I've caught her skipping her day job to sell flowers! In the last two weeks, she's actually been taking sick days and \"working from home\" in the mornings, telling her boss she's on calls or stuck in traffic when she's actually spending the first three hours of the day going door-to-door hawking paper flowers.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong. They're nice flowers. She's doing a great job at making them, and her drive is impressive. But I feel as if it's an obsession that's taking over her life, when she should be prioritizing her real work, and frankly, our relationship. We've been less intimate and have had less time for dates and other fun things because she's always working on the paper flowers. The closest we get these days is when I help her bring flower packages to the post office, or when I'm helping her take photos of the flowers. Stuff like that. I feel like I've become an accessory to her side business (which, I repeat, doesn't actually make much money at all). \n\nIt's had impacts in other ways as well. Hanging out with our friends is a struggle now, because my fianc\u00e9e doesn't want to talk about anything but the flowers.

I don't necessarily disagree with her views on animal cruelty but here's the thing, I'm a hunter. Not a trophy hunter but I do shoot feral pigs, rabbits, ducks (introduced, classified game ducks) and foxes and I fish too.\n\nAll except for the fish are classified as pests, foxes especially kill native wildlife and farm animals and farmers will often put you up on their property for free to hunt them.\n\nI have passed tests here, especially for identification of game ducks vs protected species and practice ethical hunting, i.e. allow the animal to have a fair chase, no dogs or tracking devices, practicing marksmanship and dispatching prey swiftly and humanely and not wasting the meat.\n\nNone of that is obviously good enough for Vegan. When she first came onto the team and told everyone she was vegan, I kept my mouth shut about my hunting. I also think she's really intolerant because she preaches to people about how going vegan will help with their various ailments and always turns up her nose at people heating up meat in microwave. As a result, we've kind of consciously started excluding her when we get up for lunch.\n\nHowever last year I started going hunting more regularly with a work friend from another department whose uncle owns a farm where feral pigs and like are an issue and he often swings by to have a chat about guns/bows and our next trip and she found out I was a hunter. This isn't even at our desks, it's in the kitchen area that has tables and stuff, we sometimes eat our lunches together.\n\nEver since then, every conversation I've had with her, she's referred to hunting and how cruel it is. \n\nOne time, I wore a leather pencil skirt to work and she had a go at me for wearing animal products. She seems to have singled me because of the fact that I go hunting.\n\nMy boss has no spine, I've tried talking to him about this, but she just intimidates him and makes it seem like she's been persecuted and he's back down from that.\n\nShe even tried to get a \"vegan\" shelf in the fridge and tried to rope in some Hindu vegetarian guys to do that but they pointed out that they use milk and cheese and honey in their cooking. They also think she's nuts. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where we go out for drinks on a Friday night at 5 and we never ask her. I don't organize these things, a coworker does but my boss told me, when I brought it up in one on one meeting, that she feels really left out and she seems to think it's my fault because I've been here for longer and I'm somehow poisoning them against her or something.\n\nI have since been conscious of this if anyone starts conversation about Vegan, I just say I don't talk to her unless it's work related and she's more than adequate at her job. It's actually become something of a joke or \"catchphrase\".\n\nI told my boss I don't organize anything except official events and she's always been invited. If she's not invited to informal stuff, that's not even organized by me, then that's not my problem. The coworker that doesn't invite her, she managed to piss him off because he's eaten guinea pig (he's from Peru) and she asked him if he'd eaten any of his other pets. For the record, he never ate a guinea pig that was a pet, it's something they eat in Peru.\n\nWhenever she brings up hunting or anything, I just point blank ask her there was anything work related that she wanted to talk about, and if there wasn't, I would start talking to someone else or just walk off. I have asked her multiple times to keep conversations work related. I never start a conversation with her at all.\n\nMost of the time, she pounces when I'm in the kitchen making tea, getting water or just stretching my legs.\n\nOne time last week, a group of us were talking and she got up join the discussion. A horrible silence fell over the group to the point where I just excused myself and went to me desk and so did a few others.\n\nIt all came to a head in our team meeting today when our boss, usually at the ends asks if there's any positive news or celebrations outside of work people want to share like engagements, marathons, charity appeals etc and Vegan sarcastically asked me how many \"lives I'd taken last weekend\".\n\nI got annoyed and said her constant badgering me about my hobbies and choice to eat meat was discriminatory and bothersome and that unless it was work related, she was not to engage me in conversation otherwise and told our \"scribe\" to put that in the meeting minutes.\n\nShe seemed a bit shocked by that and my boss looked uncomfortable but said fair enough. I thought that was the end of that but the right before our boss went to close the meeting, 2 other coworkers also put their hands up and asked Vegan to only engage them in work related discussions and that they were also uncomfortable being given non-medical health advice pertaining to their choice to consume meat and their diets. Again boss looked uncomfortable but asked Vegan to respect their wishes and closed the meeting.\n\nVegan didn't look anyone in the eye after that but headed straight to the bathroom. My boss was trying to get one of the coworkers to see if she was OK and I think one of them eventually checked up on her but she was in a cubicle and asked to be left alone. She eventually came out and asked my boss to leave early which she did. \n\nI feel awful now. She embarrassed me in front of my team with the \"lives taken\" comment so I pushed back but I am caught between not wanting her to miserable and not wanting anything to do with her at all.\n\nA few of my coworkers and I ended up in a proactive conference call after this with HR who basically said that always been subjected to unwanted advice and jabs about eating meat was not OK but some \"mediation\" was in order to ensure cut the tension in the workplace.\n\nThe HR rep then called my boss who explained what happened in the team meeting and complaints that we'd made one on one etc but then he went into a meeting room and didn't hear the rest of discussion.\n\nI don't know what to do, assuming she comes into work tomorrow or if I should even talk to her at all. \n\nTLDR: Vegan coworker keeps making jabs at me, I snapped and told her not to talk to me unless it was work related and 2 other coworkers followed suit.

At the time he was finishing up his degree, before moving on and working on his masters. Since we started talking, seeing each other, and dating casually; I really loved our entire relationship. Steve and I had a lot of similar interests, which included traveling. We did a small trip to South America a couple months ago for a few weeks (Peru and Chile). We had an amazing time! It was once we got back form our trip that I saw our relationship in a  whole different way. We travelled well together, and bonded in a new way. I knew I was in a great relationship! \n\nI thought we had a great relationship, until I got some news a few days ago.\n\nThree days ago, I went over to drop a macbook charger over at my best friends house, Chenelle. Chenelle and I have been best friend since we were in high school from the age of 16 years old. I have always considered her to be my number one, and closest person in my life. I have noticed that the past 6 months we haven't hangout in the same capacity that we usually have. Both of us have been busy with our lives (school, work, relationships, etc). But, I kinda got the feeling after this past year of university around April, that she was starting to drift. She had a shitty relationship with her ex that lasted under a year. He cheated on her with a coworker, and the rest is history. They broke \"officially\" around the end of January.\n\nAs I went over to drop off her extra charger that she borrowed, I talked with her mom for a bit. Chenelle ended up getting called in to pick up an extra serving shift at the restaurant she has worked at during her degree. Her mom wanted to talk to me about a few things. I was puzzled.. Chenelle's mom was always really outgoing and funny. We had known each other for over 8 years at least. But, she wanted to have a serous talk.\n\nChenelle's mom, \"Karen\", went on to tell me that she saw Steve and Chenille sneak around the back of the house about a month or so ago. Karen went on to explain that she noticed this happening two other times. At first, she thought we were all hanging out. But, Karen told me that she got a weird gut feeling on this situation. She told me that I should talk to Steve and Chenelle ASAP. \n\nSteve and I were supposed to go out for dinner last night. He picked me up, and off we went. I felt really gross and humiliated the entire time we were out. We ate dinner, had a couple drinks, but we didn't talk much. Steve kept asking me all night what was the matter. I told him \"nothing\".\n\nFinally, when we got back to my place, we sat in my room and I asked him. I asked him, and told him what Chenelle's mom (Karen) told me. He didn't answer. In fact, he went pale white. That gave me the answer I needed. I broke down and Steve tried to comfort me. I didn't want him touching me. I didn't even want to hear it! I told him to leave, but I basically had to force him to leave. I tried calling Chenelle and texted her that I needed to talk to her. I got no response. Not one.

Because our parents were either always drunk or high or never around, my sister basically had to raise me by herself. The minute she turned 18, she took me with her and we ran. We were homeless for a short while but my sister always took care of me. She worked wherever she could, always made sure I was fed and clothed, even made sure I went to school! I owe her more than you can imagine. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to go to college and a high school diploma doesn't open many doors. When she turned 20, she started working as an escort. A client of hers was really taken with her and proposed they start a sugar daddy/baby relationship. She continued on with this relationship until she was 24, pretty long for a relationship like that but my sister and this guy really liked each other and continue to be friends. My sister has always been upfront with me, and while it did take me a while to work over my feelings about my sister being a sex worker I realised that it didn't change her as a person at all. I felt guilty that she had to do all of this for me, but she always insisted that being a sugar baby was great for both of us. Her sugar daddy was this nice middle-aged Japanese man that taught her the language, got her to take the JLPT and later certified to teach Japanese (which is her current job at a local college). It seemed like for the first time in a long time my sister was able to breathe. We got an apartment, I got to continue my schooling, everything was great. \n\nCurrent issue: My sister and I still live together. My girlfriend, who I've been with for a little over a year now, was over at our apartment two months ago. We came from a party so we were both pretty drunk. When we got there, I noticed my sister wasn't home. My girlfriend asks if she can go into my sister's bathroom and use her makeup remover, and because I was wasted and not thinking (and because I trusted her) I let her go. She comes out after a few minutes with a photo she said she found in the drawer of my sister's vanity as she was looking for the makeup remover. It was an old photo of my sister and her sugar daddy hugging and looking pretty intimate. And this is where I fucked up, Reddit. At the time, I guess it wasn't just the alcohol that influenced me but the fact that I thought I knew and trusted this girl. I got giddy seeing the picture, told her this dude was the guy that helped my sister turn our lives around. I told her the whole fucking story. When I woke up in the morning, my girlfriend didn't say anything about it and I thought that was that. Fast forward to last Monday - I found out that while I had been running around getting a surprise ready for her birthday, she was fucking a friend of mine. I told her it was over, and she came over with all the excuses and begged me to take her back. Today, she messaged me with a picture she took of the photo my sister had on her vanity, and a screenshot of the guy's LinkedIn. She told me I either take her back or she'll tell my sister's bosses about how she used to be \"a filthy whore\".\n\nI'm scared Reddit and I don't know what to do. I know that sugaring isn't illegal, and that that photo can't really prove anything, but rumours like that could potentially kill my sister's career in the academia. I haven't told my sister yet and I haven't messaged her back yet. What do I do? I can't believe I've fucked this up for my sister.

Two guys across the street from us crossed over and approached us asking if we knew where such-and-such a street was. As fianc\u00e9 turned around to point out where the street was, one of the guys pulled out a knife and told us to stop moving and to give him all our shit (phone, wallet, etc). I was surprised by how calm I was in the moment, and told them I needed to reach into my coat pocket to get my phone. As I was doing that, the guy pressed the knife against my ribs as warning because I guess he was worried I had a gun (even though that\u2019s pretty unlikely in my country). When this happened, my fianc\u00e9 bolted. It took me a bit to even realise he\u2019d left me, and when I realised that he\u2019d run I was certain I was about to get badly hurt or die.\n\nFortunately, the thieves seemed to get kind of spooked by him getting away and just hurried me up. They took my phone, bag (with my purse with all my money, cards, personal effects), necklace (worth like ten bucks) and legged it. The whole ordeal from start to finish took maybe five minutes.\n\nI was kind of in shock and wandered off back up the street, heading back towards the bar, not even really thinking. A few minutes later my fianc\u00e9 found me and told me he called the police, who arrived about ten minutes later.\n\nI found out that fianc\u00e9 had run about a block away, calling emergency services as he ran. We were both okay physically, except for a tiny bit of broken skin on my ribs where they\u2019d pressed the knife.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 says what he does makes sense \u2013 that if he\u2019d hung around and it turns out they\u2019d wanted to hurt us or worse, we\u2019d both be fucked because no one else would be around to call the cops or an ambulance.

He also says that by running away, the thieves didn\u2019t want to hang around any longer than necessary (which is true), which might have saved me.

I actually took up running because he likes it and it was something I could do without him making fun of me. We planned to go on a run together and I set up a babysitter for an hour. I was waiting for him to show up and he never did. When I asked him what he was doing he said he was running. So he left me hanging while he still got to enjoy the activity. This also wasted a precious hour of babysitting time. \n\nHe is also unnecessarily cruel. I went on a four day trip with our two kids. He stayed at home because he had to work.

My husband died of cancer 4 months after they were born after being diagnosed for 48 hours. It was obviously a huge shock but luckily I have amazing family and friends that all rallied together and took care of me and my boys. I still see a therapist but the years are passing and can feel the pain fading more and more with each year. \n\nMy husband and i were very smart with our money and waited about 10 years before trying for our boys and when he died I received a considerable sum of money in the form of life insurance and such. I also am a trained RN and went back to work about a year after he died and I felt like I could be away from Luther and Donovan. However, going back to work meant placing them into a daycare program. At first it was great but then it wasn't. To spare the details I had one of my boys come home with a cut lip and black eye and magically no one saw how it happened. Granted boys can be boys but that's a fairly large injury for no one to see happen. \n\nSo I decided to hire a nanny. I went through a nanny service in my city and was paired with a couple but never really felt the \"click\" with anyone till I met Tabitha (24). Tabitha and I were instant connection from the moment we met. What's even more is the cnnection she instantly had with my twins, even Luther who is EXTREMELY shy. They all just instantly fell in love and I was so beyond grateful. I come home to a clean house, happy kids, and dinner. I more then make up in compensation to Tabitha in hopes that she'll stay with us for the years to come. \n\nBut now my problem is this. Tabitha is stunningly beautiful. I mean the first moment I met her my jaw almost touched the ground. She is the kind of natural beauty that is almost sickening because it's just so unfair that a human can look that good without even trying. Her beauty was obviously never an issue for me at all since she also happens to be an amazing person and nanny for my family.\n\nMy husband and I moved into our neighborhood about our 5th year of marriage so these are all families I know very well. Some of them actually were a huge support during the time of his death. Most of the families are young husbands and wives and a few them have nannies as well. They schedule play dates on an app called Meetup and go to parks and fun activities with all the kids. I told Tabitha about it right away and she was extremely excited to be out and about with other adults and to let the twins socialize with other kids. So the first event came and went and I of course asked Tabitha how it went. She seemed a little.... Guarded as she told, \"Fine.\" And didn't go into many more details. I just shrugged it off and honestly didn't think much about it. \n\nAbout a week later I got a notification for another meetup and told Tabitha about it. She got really really nervous and asked if she had to go. I said of course not but what was the problem? She burst into tears and said that the last play date she went to was awful. She said that the moms refused to even look at her or talk to her and when she asked a simple question of them snapped at her and said, \"obviously there's no brains in that pretty body, huh?\"  She was stunned and decided to take the boys to the park playground since she obviously wasn't welcomed. I guess that the husband of one of these moms chased her down as she was leaving and told her that it was just petty jealously and that he would talk to these women for her since they obviously did not know her and any friend of our family was welcome in the neighborhood. Then he asked for her phone number to schedule more up coming play dates that would be without the drama. Tabitha said that he was really being nice and did not pick up a creepy vibe at all. \n\nThen I guess the texts started. I know this father personally as they are next door neighbors and I just can't believe that he would do this but Tabitha even showed me her phone and it was....sickening to say the least. There's texts asking for nudes, texts saying that he watches her from his wondows, texts that say he's falling in love with her, even a text saying he would pay her $1000 just to smell her hair?!?! What the actual fuck???? \nNot only that but hen she started recieving texts from other phone numbers, numbers I don't even have in my phone claiming to be from other fathers in the neighborhood that are \"secret admirers\" and saying lewd and disgusting things to her. \n\nI literally have no idea what to do. I am not about to give up the nanny that has been nothing short of amazing with my children, that much I know. I know I could probably go to the police for the messages but what can they do? She's not a minor and they never acted upon anything but some of these messages are really unnerving. Should I raise hell in my neighborhood and risk getting blacklisted?

For a year we were very close and she was great at some points (e.g. had me over to cry right after my breakup, always invited me over for dinner with her kids). \n\nHowever, she was also dismissive of me (most of our conversations were about her; if you told her something, her usual response is to ignore it and talk about herself), to the point of being critical or rude (e.g. told me after my breakup that she didn\u2019t see me ever being married, also told me she didn\u2019t think I was capable enough to ever switch jobs). She would also roll her eyes and be sarcastic if I mentioned I had been at the gym (she was very overweight then, though I never mentioned it).

He did minimal adapting, and as a result I now feel like a single parent with a lodger that occassionally \"babysits\" our son, if I ask him to. I feel let down by him. \n\n\nAt first, I thought it could be just that he lacked confidence in dealing with a new born.. Now our son is nearly two and my partner is great at being fun with him, when he's \"on daddy duty\", but is still absolutely clueless about the rest of the things that he needs besides play. Caring that he's clean, fed and how much he has slept are exclusively mommy's problems. When I try politely inviting him to consider caring about these things, because it would help me out, I get told, a) he's shocked that I think that he doesn't care..? And, b) not to nag him because he gets enough pressure from work.\n\n\nWe met each other through work. I know his job. I had no idea that it was so very stressful that one couldn't possibly handle also being a parent. Seems like something that he should have brought up for discussion before committing to the deal. I still work part-time since becoming a mom. I do not, however, come home from work and think \"*feed and bathe my kid...? Nah... think I'm gonna ignore the kid and play on Rust for six hours, because I worked really hard today.\"*\n\n\nAaand that's how he has been for nearly two years and he is not about to change. I have asked him to help more, do more. He might say that he will, but never does. A while ago I spent an unexpected four days in hospital.. I realised how much of an idiot I had been for not insisting on \"training\" daddy, because he did not even know how to feed our son. Completely oblivious to something that we do every day, he had to ask me what he eats. He also wants us to have a second child in the next year or two. I am close to telling him that I would have to be fucking insane to have another baby with him. I always did want 2 or 3 kids someday. He is reason why that plan is now out the window. How on earth am I going to explain that without completely crushing him? I don't actually want the relationship to end. Just definitely want no more kids until he can pull his weight as a parent.\n\n\n**tl;dr** Sooner or later going to have to tell my partner that he is the reason why I don't want another baby, and it's going to hurt to hear it."}, {"comments": ["While this post is dealing in rather extreme perspectives, we wish to remind you that the encouragement of violent action, implicit or explicit, is not allowed in this subreddit.

On all fronts, he's doing great in life and is shaping up to have a very successful future. I've always considered him nothing short of perfect but recent events have taught me that my son holds incredibly disturbing beliefs.\n\n\nMy son has always been very protective of his younger sister (18F), she's currently in her last year of high school. Well, he found out a few days ago by looking at her texts (he said he wasn't snooping, but saw an unsavory text pop up and read further) about my daughter's sex life. Now I don't pry into what my daughter does in her adult life nor do I feel the need to, as my daughter practices safe and responsible sex. My husband and I both know she is sexually active but as she's going about it as an adult, in a healthy and safe way, we have no problem with it.\n\n\nMy son blew up and called my daughter all manner of horrible words, particularly \"filthy whore\" and \"putrid slut\", demeaning and humiliating her without mercy. I've never seen my daughter cry so hard, she was absolutely devastated especially since she adores her brother and looks up to him. He refused to apologize and then berated both me and his father for \"letting your daughter become a whore\".  \n\n\nWe were all shocked by this and didn't know how to react, really. It seemed so surreal like a scene in a movie, and his father asked him how he could say things like that. My son explained his beliefs and we learned he's frighteningly misogynistic and sexist and violent. For example, he believes all adulterers should be stoned to death and praises ISIS for doing so. He thinks modern women are all disgusting sluts and that there's no good women left. I don't want to list his other beliefs because just typing this makes me upset, but you get the idea.\n\n\nWe tried to reason with him but he simply won't budge on these horribly ignorant and harmful beliefs. Worse, he won't entertain any conversation about this issue with us as he believes he's completely right about these ideas. So for the past few days the atmosphere in the house is incredibly tense. He's carrying on like everything is normal but both my husband, my daughter and myself are constantly in disbelief that he could be like this. I have no idea how to even broach this topic again without him shutting me down instantly. I've raised my son to be open-minded, a true gentleman and I'm saddened that he completely abandoned that.

But we have tangled this relationship into quite a mess.\nLike everyone who posts here I have countless reasons to want to stay, but I'm having trouble taking off these rose-colored glasses. Please help me, Reddit.\n\n**Backstory:** \nWhen we started dating I was going through a lot of shit, and he was the first guy I have ever been with. I was the one who was always compromising and always finding ways to go see him. He very rarely came to see me, and if he did he would get irritated and complain that he shouldn't have to. He would ask me to come over every single night, saying he missed me and he couldn't sleep. I lived about an hour away, and I didn't even have a car, so when I'd find rides to his house (bus, friends driving me, etc.) I was excited to see him. I'd get there early in the day, and instead of seeing him, I'd sit on his couch alone for HOURS while he played video games. It was infuriating, because I played games too, but he always told me not to bring my console because I could use his (he had literally zero games for it), but I always ended up just pacing around his house, waiting for him to give me a second of his time. As bad as this sounds (and it was), he was so sweet and sincere when he would finally get done, he told me how glad he was that he could keep up with his legion and still have a girlfriend (he said although he ended up breaking up with his last three because of fidelity problems, they hated him gaming.)\n\nI was young and stupid, and caught up in being the cool girlfriend.\n\nI used to have a lot of fun, going to clubs and parties and all kinds of things. I had a ton of friends, mostly male. He would get upset if I talked to them, even the ones I had known since I was a toddler, and he said that since he didn't talk to girls then I shouldn't either. (Little did I know, he actually was talking to a few girls all this time.)\n\t\nHe said I love you two days into dating, and proposed after a few months. I told him I wasn't ready, that I loved him but I was too young and I needed to get to know him better. He was different after this, like it hurt him for me to say no. \nAfter a few months together, I'd tell him I was about to do something (like walk to the grocery store since I had no car) and he would SCREAM at me over the phone. He said I was an idiot, going to get myself killed, women can't walk alone, especially near nighttime. I know what you're thinking, why would I stay with a sexist asshole?? Well, he had never made it seem like he was sexist before, and would deny saying it. He would say he never said any such thing, and that he was only worried about me. I'd ask why he screamed, and tell him it wasn't okay to treat me like that, and he'd say \u201cI have never and will never yell at you.\u201d\n\nAt this point I'm already doubting my sanity, but the other 75% or so of the time, he's so incredibly sweet to me. I moved in with him about 10 months in because my mother died, and I had no where else to go. I had a job, but didn't make enough to support myself. His family owned farm land in the south, and had bought him his own house.\n\nAbout a year into our relationship, I found out that he'd lied about every single thing he'd told me about himself. The way I found out was the worst part; he just told me. He forgot that he'd lied in the beginning, and he'd start randomly telling me things like, \u201cI almost married my high school sweetheart, but she changed her mind last second\u201d and \u201cmy tenth or so girlfriend calls me every weekend to say she wants to fuck.\u201d This is after telling me that he's been with only three others before me, and that he doesn't talk to any exes. None of this would've mattered to me if he'd been upfront in the beginning, but because he lied and was using the whole \u201cI don't talk to girls, you can't talk to guys\u201d bullshit to keep me from having male friends, I was pretty upset. \n\nA few weeks after that, I told him I was going to the movies with a female friend for her birthday. I told him the movie was at 7 and I'd be back before midnight. We wouldn't be drinking, partying, anything like that. Well,at about 9:30 I start getting horrible texts. I'm a \u201clying bitch,\u201d I \u201cbetter enjoy the dick I'm getting because I'm never getting [his]\u201d again, and that he doesn't want to see me when I get home.\nI was crushed. It was the first time I'd seen ANY friend since we started dating, and she had never met him, but she saw what he was sending me. I ignored him and ended up getting home at 11 pm. The house was trashed, and he was up waiting for me. When I asked what the hell he was talking about, he slammed the door in my face (literally, it hit me really hard in the nose) and screamed \u201cfuck off!\u201d\n\nI slept on the couch. The next day he left without saying a word to me for a softball game he'd been planning with his friends. I was still pissed, so  I called him as soon as I woke up (btw, he was OUT OF STATE, and would be sleeping in a motel room with multiple single girls/guys for the next five days) and I told him he's an asshole I'm done. He was absolutely desperate over the phone for me to give him another chance, but I hung up. I packed everything I owned and tried to leave, but he showed up right before I could and was very sincere about getting help. \n\nThe next day, he stayed out until 5 am at a strip club and came back without his promise ring on. He said he'd put it in his pocket so he wouldn't lose it, but he smelled strange and was acting strange and I just know that he cheated. He vehemently denied it, saying I was insane for accusing him and that we should just break up if I wasn't going to trust him. I said okay, and started packing AGAIN. Then he said he'd never said any of that.\n\nAfter the fight earlier, he said he'd go to therapy, stop punching holes in the walls, pay more attention to me and even let me go to clubs again and resume contact with my male friends. Well, he did start therapy. He went for three months, and nothing changed. He continued to punch and break things, scream at me, tell me everything was my fault and that he couldn't stand me. He turned to drinking and when he'd get violent and drunk, he said I was the reason he was forced to drink. Because I was causing him so many issues. Well, things got better then they got worse, they were up and down for a while but we had a good period of about four years. \n\nThere were several large fights over the years, here a few that stand out:\n\nThe day my favorite aunt died, I was with her at the hospital. I drove a shitty vehicle there that was known for breaking down. After she passed I was a mess. I told him I was leaving and would be back soon. We lived only a few minutes down the street, but my car broke down and I was about 15 minutes late. I got home and he was furious, said I was cheating on him and that was why I was late, screamed that I was a cheater and the landlord who was our neighbor heard the whole thing, he always hated me after that. No apology after he calmed down, instead it was my fault for causing him to worry.\n\nI was feeling depressed about the amount of porn he watched versus how often he was interested in me. We used to have a ton of sex, we had six different FFM threesomes with multiple girls he chooses and I tried everything to satisfy his kinks. But then I just stopped being enough. Hint; he preferred porn and good ol' Jennifer Haniston. (hmm it's not very funny in this context huh?) \nGuys, I have zero self-esteem at this point, and I'm just dreading waking up every single morning. \n\nOne day, after a month of no sex, he locks himself in the bathroom and I can hear him in there, I get so sick to my stomach and have an anxiety attack (I'm a very in-shape, busty girl. I'm in gymnastics and have always been told I'm generally attractive, so it's not a weight issue or anything. I suspect porn addiction). I'm hyperventilating on the floor when he comes out, and he's sweet for a moment, asking what's wrong and to please talk to him.\n\nWell, I trusted him and I shouldn't have. I told him in the most calm voice I could that it makes me feel sad when he chooses porn over me, that we've had sex 4 times in three months and I wish I had more from him.\n\nHe completely lost it. He grabbed my shoulders so hard his nails dug in, he shook me and screamed that he doesn't even watch porn, that he is so whipped by a stupid bitch, that his life is shit because of me.\n\nI have always been very sensitive and I cry at the drop of a hat, I know that makes him feel like I'm trying to manipulate him. But even if I lock myself in the bathroom to cry, in private, it's still my fault and I'm using it to control him. I don't have anywhere to go, and I cannot NOT cry sometimes, is there something I could have done to show him I just need to cry sometimes?\n\n\n**That brings us to now.**\nMost of the year was good, but the past few months he's been screaming a lot more. He's told me that I am a horrible person for trying to leave him years ago, and that I don't deserve him and will never find another guy who'd put up with me. He always denies things and tries to make me sounds crazy, so this time I recorded it. Later when he was more calm I played it for him, and he accused me of inviting guys over the pretend to be him so I could get him in trouble. What the fucking fuck???\n\nHe's done much more. He's gone through every file on my computer and set the only dirty one he could find as my background to humiliate me because he knew his family was coming over. He wanted them to see the filthy shit I look at. Remember earlier how I said he has a porn addiction? Yeah, he's at a level of hypocrisy that I just can't understand. \n\nI know this is incredibly toxic and I am so sick of feeling suicidal.\n\nI just wanted to know one thing; am I the one who is abusive? I know I didn't give very many examples of things I've done, and maybe if he posted his side you'd agree with him, but what about my trying to leave? Was that a horrible act of betrayal? Because he is convinced it's worse than cheating, and says he is abused and is a victim. I am just so confused and feel constantly devastated and lonely. I have no one if I lose him :(\n\nPlease, send help\n\nTL;DR: Toxic relationship becoming too much for me to handle, and I'm confused about my role in it. Am I a horrible person? What do I do?\n\n**Edit:** I guess it doesn't really make sense for me to ask if I'm being abusive since this is from my point of view and for all you know I could just leave what I do out, so I don't really know what I'm asking. I guess I just want to see what others think. I feel like I'm crazy.\n\n**Edit 2:** He just texted me that he saw my post and is coming home\n\n:[\n\n**UPDATE:** I'm somewhere safe now!

Neither of the girls ever had to work while growing up and relied heavily on their parents money. Their parents treated them like royal princesses. Michael on the other hand was always expected to work from age 14 and go to school and achieve far more ( 4.0, be in  at least two clubs and two sports) than was expected of his sisters (who only were required to make Cs and do nothing more) Michael was rarely allowed to attend social events at school or go out on weekends. he did all chores and his parents treated him very different than his sisters. His sisters were incredibly mean to him as teenagers. Basically he was pushed around like a literal peasant until he had enough money to move out and was able to receive grants and scholarships to go to school. It was a lot of luck that played a part in his being able to attend undergrad and grad. If not for outside help, I believe his family would have left him to rot whilst giving the sisters everything they ever wanted. \n\nMichael is now an engineer while his sisters have basic minimum wage jobs (nothing wrong with that) however his sisters have done all they can to pester Michael about borrowing money, making him feel ashamed that he makes more money than they do, and even going as far as to claim that they deserve the money more than Michael does. They ask him monthly for money, which I just learned a year ago after Michael confessed to me in shame that he had been giving them money to help them through a rough patch for the past few months. \n\nApparently their mom and dad has refused to continue to support them to the large extent that they have been the past several years (maybe they finally got fed up, who knows) and now the sisters are looking to Michael. \n\nTina, Michaels eldest sister, is being really difficult lately. Apparently, she is bitter that Michael has not been giving her anymore money. And she is acting very strange about Michael's engagement. Apparently, Michael \"should he thinking about his family first\" before thinking of getting married and spending a bunch of money on a wedding and a wife. His sisters should be put first, apparently.  Now, supposedly she is pissed over my engagement ring. \n\nThis past weekend Michael and I went to visit the family and Tina and the whole family obviously learned about our recent engagement. I had never even met Michael's dad before because he travels so much for work. His mom seemed passive towards me and his dad kept asking me what my name was. It made me sad tbh. \n\nTina remarked on the large size of my engagement ring. Later in the day, she pulled Michael aside and told him that she was really suffering financially along with the rest of the family, and basically said. She was shocked Michael was forking over thousands of dollars for my engagement ring and the wedding rather than help out his own family. She said \"you've only known this chick for what, a few years? You're already giving her everything while you give your own family nothing.\" \n\nWell, Michael then informed her that my ring wasn't real diamond. It is moissanite, which I specifically wanted instead of a diamond. Michael could easily afford a diamond but we are saving our money and I liked the idea of moissanite. \n\nBut, Tina didn't believe that and expressed such. She stalked over to me in the kitchen and made a huge scene in front of everyone asking to see my ring, and examine it. She tried to play it off jokingly but I could see through it, and at one point she made a grab for my left hand. I refused to hand over my ring and Tina got emotional and the other sister, Hannah, soon butted in and asked what my problem was, Tina just wanted to look, what do I have to hide, etc. I just tried to calm the situation down as best I could and Michael kept telling them to mind their own business.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing was infuriating. We left after dinner to go stay in a hotel. Michael then told me how he thinks his sister is also jealous of me and my ring. Tina has  been engaged for over a year now with still no wedding planned, she was given a tiny ring. Albeit with a real diamond but it is very tiny. Mine, though fake, is big and sparkly and she remarked to him once that he had better not get me a prettier looking ring than she had. (Wtf?) Michael and I will be getting married fairly soon and she seems bitter that her own fiance has still not expressed a desire to start planning the wedding. She has also remarked in the past to Michael how I am too beautiful, and that my looks are somehow suspicious, and I'm just out to get his money. \n\nI make my own money as a nurse and I definitely am not using Michael for his money. \n\nNow, Tina has started creating all sorts of drama over this, posting on Facebook about how real men should know where their priorities lie, how real men stick by family and don't play with little girls who are gold diggers who only care about having a huge rock. One status said \"show me the paperwork and I might believe the ring isn't real lol\" and another one was some stupid quote about being distracted by shiny things that turn out to be coal in disguise. (Me I'm guessing lol) she commented \"lmao \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\" on my instagram picture of my ring. I deleted the comment.\n\nI only know this about her Facebook statuses because Michael showed me through his account. Tina deleted me off of everything and even blocked me. She sent out a mass email to the whole family and announced that her and Hannah will not be attending my wedding nor supporting Michaels marriage to me and then listing all of the reasons. (I don't really love him. I'm a gold digger, Michael doesn't care about his family anymore) \nHowever at the end of the email she said she may consider believing Michael if she saw proof that my ring wasn't real.\n\nReddit, I'm at a complete loss as to what to do here. Michael is also shocked but not really because he is so used to his sisters' antics. He took my side and I appreciate that but when I talked to him about cutting his family off for good he seemed hesitant. I think he just doesn't wanna create more drama. But I need him to draw hard lines here.\n\nThe thing is, I don't want Tina and Hannah coming along every few months asking for money and judging us. I don't want my marriage to involve their pettiness and begging. I won't give any of my hard earned money to them, that's for sure. I don't want Michael to either but I guess I can't force him not to. I just worry because that could be money our future children need. Or money WE need. \n\nHow can I handle this situation? At this point I never wanna see the sisters again. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: crazy soon to be SILs are creating drama over my engagement ring, and telling everyone I'm a gold digger.

Realistically though it was an unhealthy coping mechanism. How is your self esteem? Do you validate yourself largely through external relationships?", "Therapist here!\n\nCRUSHES ARE SO FUCKING HARD.

Good on you that you recognize the unhealthy nature of this crush and honestly, the way you're responding to it makes sense because there's a LOT of tension I bet.

So I've had this crush on my coworker for a few months now, and it's really not good. We only see eachother in passing, and he's only talked to me once about something work related. Even though we don't talk, we do look at each other sometimes, so we notice each other's existence. He's very outgoing and friendly with other people on my team. He's also very attractive. I enjoy being around him, but I'm way too nervous to talk to him. Honestly, I basically just admire him from afar. I'm not interested in a relationship with anyone right now, partially because I need therapy to heal from past relationships first, so I'm definitely not trying to be together with him. I just like him.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad, except it's become unhealthy for me. Whenever he's around, I get so overwhelmed that it's difficult to concentrate on my work. Sometimes I have to walk away and take deep breaths to calm down. I just get so nervous and preoccupied with my thoughts. I realize this sounds ridiculous, it is. I also can't stop thinking about him. It seems like I spend the entire day looking forward to seeing him, then once he's gone I feel empty and sad. I recognize this is really unhealthy and potentially creepy.\n\nI work with some good friends and I genuinely enjoy their company, I also like my job a lot so it's not that work is boring without him. I'm actually a very talkative and happy person with everyone else. I really want to get over these feelings because they're useless and only hurting me. To be honest, this isn't the first co-worker I've felt this way about. At my last job, I also had a crush on my manager and it was on the same unhealthy level. So I feel like becoming fixated on people is reoccuring problem, and I really would like to know how I can change this pattern.\n\nI welcome your honest thoughts on this situation.\n\nTL;DR: I have a coworker that I really like, even though we never talk, and it's become an unhealthy crush because I get so overwhelmed when he is around that it's interfering with my job. I already accept that we won't (and shouldn't) be together. I just need advice on getting over him and changing whatever is causing me to feel this way.\n\nEDIT: I seriously can't believe how many people have responded to my post. Every single comment has something very relevant and beneficial to say, and you all have given me a lot of insight about my feelings and ways to cope. All of your compassionate and understanding words are helping me tremendously. I'm sincerely thankful for all of your responses. I will take your suggestions to heart, and as some of you advised I'll bring this up during therapy when I get the chance to go. I will take some time to reply to individual posts soon, but please know I'm reading all of them and am truly grateful for your input. Also, that so many of you can relate to having unhealthy crushes makes me both happy and sad. It feels good to know I'm not alone, although I wish the best for all of us, that we can move on and find fulfillment in our lives.

It's a tradition among our friends and we've participated in the past but this year I'm not up for it. \n\nThe main reason is that our son is only five weeks-old. I'm pretty much recovered physically from my c-section but my mind and body are still **tired**. Our pediatrician said it's important to make sure people wash their hands before touching him because we're entering cold & flu season. I don't want to have to worry about it all night or be \"that mom\" reminding everybody to wash their hands. \n\nThere are other, less significant, reasons too. Most of our friends don't have kids yet. I can't/don't want to drink alcohol, which is always a major part of our Friendsgiving. Being the only sober person by the end of the night will definitely be annoying. The couple hosting this year also have two dogs and three cats, the house is covered in pet hair and the animals climb all over people and the furniture. It's uncomfortable for me because I'm allergic to cats and I don't care for animals climbing on and/or licking me. I wouldn't be happy if one of the pets was all over the baby and it's possible he has allergies too.\n\n**I just don't want to go.**\n\nDuring my pregnancy my husband frequently reminded me he didn't want the baby to change everything or become the center of our lives (lol). I believe this is why he's annoyed about Friendsgiving. We got into an argument earlier and I brought this up, I told him he's being unrealistic, which apparently really bothered him. I told him he can do whatever he wants but I'm staying home. I have no desire to attend this year and I think he could try harder to have some empathy, I just had a baby FFS. He's so paranoid about our lives *god forbid* changing that he's failing to recognize he's being inconsiderate and causing me to feel some resentment towards him.\n\nI love my husband and I don't like feeling this way about him. I don't know what to do here. I understand his concerns but holy shit, he needs to back off, our son is **five weeks old**. \n\nDo you think I'm wrong to want to stay home? \n\nHow can I help him see this from my perspective? I want to spend Saturday night relaxing at home, snuggling with my baby, and maybe preparing for actual Thanksgiving. Socializing is the farthest thing from my mind and actually sounds overwhelming and stressful. But he doesn't see it this way. It's all about me being a boring mom now and not trying hard enough to be the 'cool' wife/mom/friend. \n\n**Update**: We talked a little last night when he came home. I acknowledged his feelings and concerns and assured him I think they're completely valid. However, the way he communicates with me on this issue needs to change (and he agreed). I told him he's pushing me away and I'm growing resentful. I also mentioned how I'm afraid to be vulnerable with him because I worry he'll just criticize me. It was late so we didn't talk long but he seemed to understand. He apologized for being so hard on me about this and he said he didn't realize it was taking such a big toll on me. We'll definitely have more in-depth conversation about this soon. **Thank you for all of your help, reassurance, and kind words.**\n\nAlso, because people asked about these things:\n\n- I do take the baby out. I think fresh air is good for babies. I tend to avoid taking him to places indoors with a lot of people, though.\n\n- My husband is a good dad. He takes care of our son and spends time with him. He has him on a blanket in the backyard right now (doing tummy time).\n\n- Maintaining a social life is important to me. Being a mom is part of who I am now but it's one aspect of my life. Our son needs a lot of my time and attention and I *want* to give it to him. But that doesn't mean it will be like this forever. I don't think it's unreasonable to give a new mom time to enjoy loving on the baby and that doesn't mean that's all she'll ever want to do going forward. I actually said this to my husband last night and I could tell it resonated with him. \n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My (very social) husband is annoyed with me because I am not attending Friendsgiving. Our baby is 5 weeks-old and I'm not feeling it. He thinks this is the beginning of the end and our social lives are doomed because I \"won't\" try harder to be social and outgoing.

Honestly, if that money had been be spent so you could working less, or invested in your future or on a nice getaway for the two of you it would have benefited him alot and he should have been grateful for that. Even spending a large chunk of it on something nice for just you would have been fair as appriciation for all the hard work you've put in to support your household. But he only cared about what he felt was owed him and what he wanted. You're damn right to be angry at that! How selfish can he be?\n\nThen you got angry because he tried to pressure and manipulate you into getting what he wanted. No compromise and no consern for what you might want or think, but again it was \"me me me\". Only more because now he wasn't only upset that he wasn't getting \"his\" money, but actually trying to figure out how to get \"his\" money from you without your approval. He didn't care how you felt about it if he got a car out of it. This feels little better than theft, but via entitlement and manipulation instead of ouright stealing it. Again, your anger is extremly justifiable.\n\nThen you were conviced that as long as you had the money he would never stop trying to take it. Always looking for a new way to get to the money and not caring what it did to you or your relationship. Of course you got rid of it! It was self preservation to stop him from tearing throug you to get to your money.\n\nIt might have been done in anger, but it was an anger born from needing to fight for yourself.

She's been in therapy for 6 years, and I guess I never knew how bad it was until moving in with her, a lot of which she's hidden from me. I don't want this to get too long, so here's some of the highlights in no particular order:\n\n* She recently was promoted into accounts payable at her company and realized she is the lowest paid person on payroll. She didn't negotiate a good starting wage, and has never asked for a raise, or had one, despite multiple promotions.\n\n* She inherited a car a few months ago and sold it. She had offers online from $18k-$25k, but sold it to the first person who showed up for $10k.\n\n* She caught someone stealing her bike at college. The woman stealing the bike managed to convince my fiance that it was actually her bike and my fiance just let her take it, despite the fact that she caught the woman cutting her bike lock.\n\n* Last spring was my 30th birthday and she ordered a giant chocolate cake for the party. The cake normally comes with nuts, but given my allergy for nuts she ordered it without them. Well when she went to pick it up and it had nuts on it, she just paid for it and brought it home. I couldn't even be in the same room as the cake.\n\nWhich brings us to tomorrow. My father recently passed away and I need to fly to the other end of the country to get things sorted out with family, attend the funeral, etc.. Meanwhile, we recently had a pipe burst in our home, and the contractors will be out tomorrow to fix it. My flight's at 6am and my fiance will have to handle it, including all the negotiations because we don't know the extent of the damages.\n\nI've been giving it a lot of thought and I just don't trust my fiance to handle it. And if I can't trust or rely on her to do something like this, how can we really be life partners? I mean I trust that she is always looking out for me, and has my best interest at heart, but I can't trust her to get things done.\n\nWe've talked about it a few times before, but it's been unproductive.

We had hired a house sitter (Clara) to come over every day and feed our cats, check the mail, and also water my plants every three days. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen we entered our house I instinctively turned to drop my keys into the key bowl and they hit the ground. We turned on our lights and our foyer had been completely rearranged. Our first thought was we had been robbed and we began to move through the house checking every room to make sure we were home alone, ready to dial 911. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat we discovered was just bizarre. All of our furniture had been rearranged, our living room, dining room, tv and stereo system, office, bedroom, my craft room, the den, my husband's game room. Even my piano has been moved!!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack in the kitchen we were looking around and I noticed that my pantry door was open. When I went to close it I realized my entire walk in pantry had been completely rearranged floor to ceiling. I started opening cabinets and all my baking supplies, pots and pans, cutlery, and even my silverware and junk drawers have been moved.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs I was frantically looking through the bedroom and office making sure nothing had been stolen and our safe was intact, Rory found a note from Clara. In it she stated that she'd enjoyed house sitting for us and she hoped that we liked our new living space. That she has been taking a course in interior design and she decided to \"allow us to become her first client, pro bono\" (her words!). She placed pieces from other rooms in different rooms so it wasn't as easy as just switching each room back to how it was. She took down pictures and artwork, *patched the holes in the walls*, and hung my artwork in different rooms!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReddit.....we do NOT like our new living space. What she did completely messed up the flow of our home. Rory and I spent over six months rearranging furniture and trying pieces in different rooms until we found exactly what we liked best.

It really made us feel like our home was truly ours. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI really did not know what to say to her so I haven't talked to her yet. Clara is my friend and so Rory is leaving it up to me to deal with this. We spent three days putting our home back together again and I don't know how to deal with this. She has emailed me and asked what I think about the house and asked if I'd write a review for her new interior design business!! The level of entitlement was just mind boggling and then for her to expect a pat on the back and a review as well?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI do not know how to address this with her because honestly I'm afraid that if I don't have a script in mind, I will just begin screaming at her. I feel incredibly violated, almost as if someone had broken into the house. Both Rory and I are OCD, and I have GAD. I'm having difficulty sleeping at night and I am so uncomfortable in the house ever since we got home. How do I explain that this was unappreciated and highly violating? Should I even mention that it was a really, really shitty design job? \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nShe is a SAHM and she is often bored and then \"opens a business\" and six months later drops it and never does it again. She's been a photographer, a caterer, a cake decorator, and now I guess an interior designer. Always unlicensed and she always leaves someone in a lurch. She was supposed to cater a wedding. She got bored, quit doing it, and didn't tell the bride until a month before the wedding. Same with doing baby photo shoots and a few people's cakes for birthdays or baby showers. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe seems to enjoy the thrill of new business cards, buying all the equipment, making a Facebook business page, and then once she starts getting jobs (because unfortunately she's one of those people that are great at everything they pick up) she gets bored and quits. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease tell me what to say and how to address this!!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR After going on vacation for two weeks, my husband and I returned home only to find all of our furniture moved around.

The first few times I went to knitting group I had mild panic attacks and it was quite obvious I had issues with my yarn tension due to my anxiety. Our entire knitting group really rallied around me and appointed themselves my surrogate \"grandmas and sisters\". This is one of the big reasons that I didn't think twice about having her housesit, as she knew about them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI showed Rory the thread and he agreed with me that we did need to address it soon so I wrote an email to Clara based on the comments of /u/tingiling and /u/illinoiscentralst.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Dear Clara,\n\n\n>I'm so very hurt and angry about what you have done.

All she replied back with was \"I'm so sorry and I would like to explain.\" I have what I want to say charted it out and I've practiced it with Rory until I'm blue in the face. I'm not sure what she could explain to me but I'm interested to hear what it could be. I called a few women from the knitting group and I asked them if they'd heard that Clara had done anything to my house. They had not. I asked them to tea on Thursday to speak with them.

We were very in love and things were perfect for a good while. Her birth control failed six years ago, and I told her that I would support whatever choice she made. She scheduled an abortion, but backed out the day before and we became loving and enthusiastic parents. Later on down the road, she decided she wanted another child and so we had our second daughter. They are five and three years old, and absolutely perfect. They are both very well behaved and ahead of the curve for kids their ages. \n\nAnother thing that's worth mentioning, my wife is a SAHM. My job is very demanding and I am out of town for weeklong stretches at a time once a month, and then 9-6 the rest of the month. I've had this schedule since we were married, basically.

After much prodding she admitted that she regretted having kids. I said that there were times where I felt overwhelmed too, but that I would always love our daughters. She got quiet. She mumbled something and I asked her to say it again. She yelled \"I DON'T LOVE THEM\" and then started sobbing.\n\nI sat there with my mouth hanging open.

They go to pre-k for six hours a day four days a week. My mom takes them pretty much every other weekend. She gets a lot of time to herself, even though it could be more, and on nights when I'm home she goes out with her friends often, and lately when I'm home she doesn't see the kids at all... It's still possible that she's overwhelmed, but she's not the isolated 'barefoot and pregnant' chained to the stove woman you're picturing here.\n\nWe've both always been pretty low libido, I would say we have sex once a week and we try to have a date night every other week (leaving the girls with my mother). We are very affectionate towards one another.\nShe graduated with an art degree. When we first got married she was working as a teacher, she taught english and art in a local high school. She hated it, and she quit when she was pregnant with our first. She has a \"studio\" in our house, basically an extra bedroom with all her art stuff in it that the kids aren't allowed in, and she paints when the kids are out of the house. She feels like her degree is useless, but told me she wasn't interested in going back to school.\n\nWe used to pay for a weekly maid service, but my wife decided she didn't want to spare the expense.\n\nI'm just looking for input right now. Honestly I feel like her response to this situation was completely out of line and nearly unbelievable, and I'm not sure I want to continue a relationship with someone who considers giving away her kids before even asking for help.

I live in a large city in the United States, and take the subway/metro to work every day. A few weeks ago, I was finishing up my breakfast outside the train station, and a little piece of toast got stuck in my windpipe. I tried to cough it back up but I couldn't breathe, and started freaking out. I ran to the nearest people, two men in their 20s/30s, and made it clear I was choking. One of them had a water bottle and I was able to drink some and dislodge the piece of toast. The two men were very concerned and made sure I was okay before I left, which I appreciated very much. I thanked them profusely and went on my way to work. I thought I would be done with this whole situation, but then things got weird. \n\nA few days after the choking incident, I was walking home from the store and all of a sudden a man runs up to me to stop me. I realize it was one of the men who helped save me, and he introduced himself (let\u2019s call him \u201cJohn\u201d). We started talking and I thanked him again. He then started telling me he\u2019s been thinking about me every day and talking to me about religion and how he thinks God put me in his life. He then asked where I lived, to which I gave a very vague answer, and said \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask for your number right now, but I would like to get to know you.\u201d I told him that I am in a relationship, but that didn\u2019t really seem to sink in. I told him I had to go, and the conversation ended with him saying \u201cI know I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d \n\nI saw him again the next morning. He was standing outside the subway/metro entrance I normally use (and where I choked). I realized it was him and tried to quickly go past him so he wouldn't recognize me\u2026but once I was almost at the end of the escalator, I heard someone running down the steps. Sure enough, it was John. He had run all the way down the escalator to catch up with me, and he said \u201cI\u2019m glad I saw you again. I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d I was really shocked, and said something like \u201coh\u201d before I turned and hurriedly walked to the train platform. \n\nAfter that incident, I started taking a different entrance to the train. I hadn\u2019t seen him for a week\u2026until I saw him again today. I was walking home from the store with my boyfriend, and all of a sudden I saw someone come up from behind my boyfriend. I realized it was John but acted like I didn\u2019t see him, and kept focusing on talking to my boyfriend.

Thank you. \n  \nEDIT: I should have made this more clear, but I expressed my disinterest in him multiple times during the second encounter. When he said he wanted to get to know me, I told him that I wasn't interested, that I needed to get on with my life, and that I am in fact in a relationship.

Yes, his early death was likely preventable, but that doesn\u2019t make his loss any less significant. Don\u2019t talk about how anyone could have seen this coming or his old habits. That\u2019s something the parents will sort out on their own if they ever get into therapy. It\u2019s also horribly, horribly depressing having to bury a child, so their grief is understandable (but obviously not their coping mechanisms).

Since his death, my in-laws have been beside themselves, statements like \u201cthey never saw this coming\u201d and \u201che was SO young, it could happen to ANYONE\u201d have been common. The thing is, my BIL was not the paragon of health. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised he made it to 34. First, my BIL lived with his parents and worked as a library assistant. He worked from 11-7, would get two large pizzas on his way home, eat the pizzas, leftovers at home, drink 1 or 2 2L sodas and smoke probably more than a pack of cigarettes (20 regular cigarettes) an evening. He hadn\u2019t eaten a vegetable in more than 20 years \u2013 something he was proud of \u2013 had diabetes, a bad back (which is why he couldn\u2019t exercise) and would help wind-down every evening with about a gallon of cheap beer. He\u2019d wake-up at 8:45, microwave himself a few breakfast sandwiches/burritos (7 or 8) and would smoke another 10 cigarettes. He\u2019d toddle off to work. He did that M-F, on Sat & Sun, he laid in bed till 2, watched TV, chain smoked cigarettes, ordered either Chinese take-out (meat only) or burgers, would drink beer from 4 until 1 or 2 AM and then pass out. He literally never left his room. \n\nBIL was warned by numerous doctors to get healthier, cut the smokes, stop drinking and to clean up, but he never did. Even when he got diabetes and spent almost a week in hospital, it didn\u2019t phase him. He had begun to walk with a cane \u2013 he was only about 5\u20197 but well north of 350lbs. He didn\u2019t drink water, he didn\u2019t eat a vegetable, he lived in his room and was never, ever healthy. Last year, he suffered a major heart attack and required emergency bypass surgery. He barely made it through the surgery, he was so unhealthy that he nearly passed away many times during surgery/recovery. He spent 3 weeks in the hospital. \n\nHe got home and immediately resumed his habits. Just days after he got home, he was in bed, with a bag of cookies on his chest and an ashtray next to his bed. The home care workers tried, his surgeons tried, everyone tried to break him of his habit\u2026 Except his parents who didn\u2019t want to upset their son\u2026.\n\nAnyway, a couple of months after surgery he died in bed. He had deteriorated rapidly, could barely move, had no energy, was white & gaunt and had trouble breathing. He refused medical attention and finally passed away. It was tragic, and everyone mourned. Since then, my in-laws have had their eyes-opened to the fragility of life and have been booking the ENTIRE family on events. I went along with it for a while, but it\u2019s gotten excessive \u2013 we\u2019re expected to be with them every Saturday (even when they just sit around telling stories about someone who never existed\u2026); we\u2019re expected to be there when they need support and they\u2019ve began booking us for every holiday: Thanksgiving & Christmas are being renamed \u201cBIL Remembrance Days\u201d. No celebration but rather informal wakes will be held in his honor. \n\nI get they are sad and upset, but this is beyond crazy. My wife [28/F] has another sister [34/F] and brother [37/M].  They & their partners think this is getting out of hand. They\u2019ve all pulled out of these events, but my wife won\u2019t stand up to her parents. She\u2019s the baby and doesn\u2019t want to disappoint them. The thing is, it\u2019s gone way beyond. My birthday involved my in-laws coming over and making a \u201cspeech\u201d (more like a lecture) about how deceased BIL would love this party. It went on for well over an hour, attempts to stop them failed and finally my mother had to physically remove them. They apologized when it became obvious everyone was so uncomfortable that they left. \n\nThey need therapy, but they think this is all part of the grieving process. They refuse to talk to someone; they refuse to get help in any way whatsoever leaving my wife to carry the burden and for me to deal with their shit. They both informally \u201cretired\u201d but can\u2019t afford it; they didn\u2019t really do their taxes (so I\u2019m dealing with it) and aren\u2019t keeping up with bills, so I\u2019m their financial advisor. I haven\u2019t had a weekend to myself in 5 months and I don\u2019t want to give up holidays with my folks, so my in-laws can make-up stories about their son. I've had to help my FIL apply for jobs; I've had to give my MIL prepaid visa gift cards to prevent her from going wild on spending. I've structured their finances in such a way that they are okay, but what they need is long-term mental help to get them working again. \n\nI know it sounds cold & callous, but I\u2019ve hit my limit. How can I get my wife to take my side and deal with her parents who obviously need therapy and support? \n\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: BIL ate & drank himself to death and has sent my in-laws off the deep end.

Britt is a few months out of a 9-year relationship. Both of them have expressed wanting to meet other people, and I thought they'd be good for each other because of common interests and we all have kids of similar ages. \n\nTwo days before Christmas, Chuck and Britt went out on their first date. I kept Chuck's daughter at my house so the two could have some more time together without him having to worry about the baby.\n\nThe plan was for her to spend the night (she's done it before and gets along great with my 3 year old girl), but Chuck knocked on my door at 11pm to get his daughter. He barely said a word to me and I could tell he had been crying, but he wouldn't tell me what was wrong. \n\nThe next day, I asked Britt what happened. She said that they had dinner and a couple drinks, things were going excellent. She said she felt like they had great chemistry and were even getting physical at his house, but he suddenly told her to stop and to leave immediately. She swears that she has no idea what she did wrong and is really hurt by the whole thing. I believe her because she is really sweet and social, I've never seen her do anything to piss anyone off. \n\nI tried to talk to Chuck at the same time to get his side of the story and see what went wrong. All he said that he \"wasn't feeling it\" and didn't want to discuss it further. I didn't push it, but when I went to wish him a merry Christmas a day later, I saw he had deleted me from his social media. I texted it to him instead and asked \"you okay?\" but no response. \n\nI am seriously hurt and don't know what to do. Chuck has become one of my closest friends, and our daughters are the best of friends too. I am really worried that this has something to do with his wife, and I want to apologize if he felt like I was pressuring him to date after her death. At the same time, I don't want to overstep boundaries and bother him when he's having a hard time. It's been over a week and I'm worried/upset. \n\n**tldr: I set my two friends up on a date. Things were apparently going well until my guy friend suddenly called off the date. He has now deleted me from his social media and will not talk to me.**\n\n**EDIT: Someone mentioned that Chuck may be in love with me, but deleted the comment. I still want to address that. He's almost a full decade older than me, and has never expressed those feelings for me at all. In fact, the week before he cut me off, he said that I was a great friend and he was happy that his daughter had some female figures in her life.**\n\n**EDIT 2: Thanks for all of your advice, everyone.

My sister (like every other woman in my family) got pregnant when she was 16, and moved out on social assistance. I wanted to break the cycle, and although I tot pregnant at 20, I went to university, married the father of my child and am now working towards my Masters. I have a lot of pride in the fact that I broke a 3 generation teen pregnancy, high school drop out cycle.\n\nMy sister now has five kids ranging in age from 10-3. Normally, I couldn't care less how many kids someone has because it's none of my business, but this whole situation is impacting everyone negatively. \n\nMy sister and her husband do not work. They have to get Christmas hampers, borrow money, and live on social assistance. They also don't take care of their house. It's literally like an episode of hoarders in there. There's cat and dog poop all over the floors, mouldy food everywhere, dirty diapers etc. My nephew was once so hungry I caught him eating a bowl of mouldy cheerios once when I visited(I'm tearing up just writing that). We have all gone there multiple times to try and help them clean up, and have gotten 2-3 dumpsters full of garbage out each time. \n\nEvery time my husband and I take the kids, we have to take them out and buy them clothes for while they're staying with us. The clothes they come in don't fit, reek like cat pee and are always inappropriate for the situation. For example, every summer we take one of them camping (they never get to do anything with out all their siblings and it's something they each look forward to each year).  It was a 6 day camping trip and all that was in my nieces bag were a pair of her older brothers jogging pants (he's 10, she's 5!) And a weird ripped fleece dress that was 3 sizes too small. This is a common occurrence. \n\nOn Sunday we had our sons birthday party and all the nieces and nephews were invited. 3 of them don't have any winter gear and were wearing Jean jackets and running shoes in negative 10 degree weather. The oldest had dog poop on his pants, and the youngest had gum stuck in her hair. The entire time all my sister would talk about was how they can't wait to have their sixth child and they're already trying.\n\nI'm honestly shocked. They have no means to take care of the five of they have. I get that it's not really my business, but the fact is, children's services are already very involved. If things get any worse, they will lose all the kids and the general family consensus seems to be that I'll take them in when that happens. I love those kids, but my husband and I have worked extremely hard to be able to give our two children good lives. I don't want to sacrifice their happiness and well being because of someone else's mistakes. \n\nOn top of all this, my sister has been diagnosed with some sort of personality disorder and her psychologist straight up told her she should stop having babies because it's negatively affecting her. \n\nI'm so saddened by this.

Dan thinks I don't care about our son as much as he does since I worked on losing the baby weight and still put effort into my appearance. \n\nI feel like keeping this part of my identity actually helps me be a better mother. I love my son but I'm still me and I still have the things I like to do. Dressing wel my identity actually helps me be a better mother.

He got pretty tipsy but not wasted; I didn't drink since I was driving us home. At some point in the night I went to go get water and when I came back, there was a crush of people in the room so I was standing directly behind him, trying to get through. \n\nHe was talking to some girl and I heard her ask, \"So is that girl you came in with your girlfriend?\" And he distinctly said after some hesitation, \"No, she's just my roommate haha.\" I got really pissed off but didn't say anything, just came up to stand next to him. I didn't want to make a scene at my friend's birthday party, but he was going to get an earful when we left. He didn't even notice me for a few seconds and said something like, \"You're so pretty,\" to the other girl. She noticed me \nglaring at him and left. \n\nI was so pissed off at him that I just decided to walk away and talk to my friends the rest of the night. Probably a mistake of not addressing it right there at the time but I wanted to avoid a big scene if I could. I tried to enjoy myself. My friend, the host of the party, came up to me and asked me if my boyfriend and I had broken up and she didn't know, because she had heard him telling somebody that he was single.\n\nAfter that, I just decided to go home. I was really mad. He could find a ride or crash at our friend's place (she said it would be okay because tons of people were crashing in the living room already). I went home without saying a word to him. This morning I woke up to all of these texts and calls from him *really* pissed that I ditched him at the party without a ride or without warning. He demanded to know in an accusing voice \"where I had disappeared off to,\" as if *I* was the one up to some shady shit. \n\nI'm just angry and confused because this is coming out of nowhere for me. We have a great relationship and have never had a fight. He tells me all the time that he's so happy we're together and that I'm the best thing that ever happened to him and that he wants to be with me forever. And now pretending I'm not his girlfriend? Claiming he's single? Flirting with other girls right in front of me? He has never done anything like that before and hasn't even looked at other girls... \n\nI don't drink, so is this just dumb \"drunken behavior\" that I should excuse? Should I give him a chance to explain himself or just end things now? I'm so pissed off and feel so disrespected. I can't even think of what reason he could give that would somehow make what he did okay in my eyes. But I'm willing to listen to anyone's perspective or other angles on the situation. \n\n**tl;dr: Went to a party with my boyfriend last night. He got tipsy and was overheard telling multiple people that he didn't have a girlfriend or that he was single, when I was right there at the same party. I left without saying a word to him. This morning he's demanding to know why. Do I confront him or just leave him?**\n\nUPDATE: I texted him, \"You made it clear last night that you are single. I don't wait around for ex-boyfriends to give them rides home. Don't bother coming back here\" as /u/boyd1211 suggested. He immediately tried to call me and I didn't pick up. Then he texted, \"Wtf are you talking about???\" \n\nHow could he not know? My friend (the host) even just texted me and told him she'd given him an earful all morning when he woke up for being such a dickbag to me. He denied everything and said he has no idea what she's talking about. They got into a fight about it because he stuck to his guns and claims he never said any of that stuff. I have a feeling he's going to pretend he doesn't remember or blacked out as a way to get out of this. He said he's getting a ride back to my place now. I'm considering not answering the door, but what if he really doesn't remember...? I kind of don't care, though. :/ He's coming here now, what do I do?!\n\nUPDATE 2: He's almost here. My friend told me to talk to him \"just to hear the complete load of shit he's going to unleash on you. Dump him girl, I would\"--and she's known him for longer than she's known me! I'm not going to answer the door. Thanks, all. \n\n**UPDATE 3**: I know most of you will be disappointed to hear this, but I decided to give him another chance.\n\n...Just kidding. I only kid because I'm still bawling my eyes out. I did decide to answer the door and hear what he had to say, if only to try to understand his reasons behind it (not as a way to forgive him, but to fully understand why).\n\nAt first he denied it and said that none of it ever happened, and that my friend was lying to me because she was jealous of us and had always \"wanted him\" (she has a boyfriend of three years). He said he had no idea what she was talking about or why I was so mad at him. I just said, \"I heard you say it, too.\" He said, \"Say what???\" But then he just saw the look on my face and crumbled.\nHe said that prior to us dating, he had never gotten attention from girls before and it went to his head when it happened last night. He said that he'd always felt \"in disbelief\" because he believed I was out of his league and it was pure fluke that I'd ever been interested in him. Apparently girls never approached him before we were dating, ever, so when it happened at the party he \"didn't know how to react.\" (!)\n\nHe said he \"enjoyed the attention for once in his life and just went with it.\" According to him he wasn't planning on doing anything but just impulsively said whatever to keep the attention coming. He swears up and down that he just enjoyed the ego boost that came from girls being interested in him, but he would never ever cheat on me. In his mind he thought it was \"harmless\" because he knew he would never let it go further than feeding his ego, and that if he'd known that I would hear, he never would have done it and risked hurting me.\n\nAt this point I started to cry, because to me it was such a STUPID reason to throw away what we had. I know some of you will say that I should forgive him (got a lot of PM's and comments saying \"it was just a dumb mistake\" and \"I say dumb shit I don't mean when I'm drunk too\") but I just can't. He broke my trust in him and, honestly, he hurt my pride. I want a guy who can handle when some other girl shows interest in him with maturity and respect... a guy who loves me so much that he would never dream of leading a girl on for attention because I feel like my attention should be enough... Someone who's proud to point at me and say \"Sorry, I'm taken and she's a great girl\" with no regrets.\n\nI told him that I thought it was a really stupid reason to damage our relationship (being insecure and an attention-whore) and I guess it must have sunk in that I was planning to leave him. He broke down crying too and begged me to please try to forgive him because it was a stupid drunken mistake. It was so hard to stay strong, but I was very angry with him. I cried so hard because he started telling me he loved me more than anyone and he was just stupid, drunk, and inexperienced and he wished he could take it all back because it wasn't worth losing me.\n\nI said I was glad he realized his mistake, but if he really \"loved me more than anyone\" than he really needed a better way to show it than pretending I don't exist to other pretty girls. He got hysterical and just started saying, \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I can't lose you! Please forgive me!\"\n\nI told him that I thought his actions last night were honestly pathetic and disgusting and they changed my view of him. I told him it was sad that he would throw himself after a girl and lie just to get a few minutes of attention and that I didn't think it was a good excuse to say \"that never happened to me before so I didn't know how to handle\" or \"I was just innocently enjoying the attention.\" What would happen next time? How could I trust him to act appropriately and control himself? He said that \"he'd learned from this\" and he'd do better next time but honestly I just couldn't get over it. He made me feel worthless as his girlfriend and something he had to hide to get the attention of other women because my attention wasn't adequate. I know that isn't necessarily true but that's just how he made me feel. I also told him he'd lowered himself in my eyes and I didn't respect him anymore.\n\nSo I told him to get out and not talk to me anymore. I'm leaving a box of his stuff on the porch so he can get it without talking to me. Then I laid my couch and cried with my dog until I felt sick. It shouldn't feel this shitty because I'm still really mad at him. But we had an amazing year together and it sucks that something so small and stupid could cause him to jeopardize that. I don't want to be with a guy who values our relationship so little.\n\nI feel better today. It sucks not being in a relationship anymore but I feel like I deserve better. He's been blowing up my phone saying he's been at home crying and he loves me so much. I'm just waiting for him to pick up his stuff so I can block his number.\n\nMy best friend also just broke up with his girlfriend of 2 years, so we're planning a road trip together to take our mind off things.

If she respects her parents then maybe if you could win them over they could make her see that she's not only stepped over some boundaries, but is not responding well to a situation that she's created.\n", "My therapist tells me to write a journal, and to be honest about the things I put. Writing things down is a very healthy way of dealing with things, I think you should take her up on the therapy, but us it deal with your relationship with your mother. I know my mum is pretty annoying in a similar way,and my therapist has help me cope/respond to that significantly. Also with your permission, the therapist may be able to discuss things together with you and your mom and also explain to her how journals work and how they are a very healthy thing and that despite occasional dark thoughts, this doesn't mean you are suicidal or not normal... in fact.. for a teenager these are all pretty standard, and your manifesting then in a good way, rather than keeping it all in till you implode. \n\nlike u//John_MayerMaynot says \n>Why would you punish someone to this extreme if you thought they were suicidal? Wouldn't you theoretically be exacerbating a situation that could potentially send them to their grave earlier than planned? To me, this is the part that is truly backward.\n\nthis is all astounding to me. \n\n You seem very mature compared to a lot of the 16 years I read on here, so I wish you all the luck in the world, and I'm sure this wont hold out for long, explain to your boyfriend if you can whats happened, your mum might make you break up with him in front of her, maybe if you can prewarn him he'll know its not a real break up as such.", "Just to put the thins into perspective. I'm a 49-years old dad with a 15-years old boy. I'm not a kid who aligns with another kid. I am writing from the perspective of a teenager's  parent.\n\nSo, you are grounded. And what are your guilts?\n\n1) being in love with a guy she approved. \nReally can't see the guilt here. \n\n> \"she was worried I was \"in love\" with him, \" \n\nThat phrase is really worrying. She is projecting on you her experiences, and wants to align your life to the equation love=evil. i.e. she wants to project in your life her (probably sad) story, making your life sad too\n\nI mean, she's ok with you having sex but not you loving the guy? Are we kidding? \n\n2) writing about suicide. \n\nI know you sometimes just write down thisgs to let the steam out, but just for the sake of argument, let's assume you were serious and really wrote \"I am killing myself. I'll do it with a chainsaw, on wednesdday\". (full intention, planning, technical details. you don't get more seriuos than that)\n\nAs I was saying, even if it were so, that's something you HELP people for, not PUNISH them.\n\n3) keeping a diary. \n\nThat's all the sense I can get from her \"betraying her trust and not talking to her about problems this serious.\"\n\nShe has hard time accepting the fact you are growing into an adult and you are therefore detaching from her and keeping things private. \n\nShe's a mum who has lived alone with her daughter for ~~24~~ 9 years, building a \"we only\" world around. The idea of you having your own life SEPARATE from hers, is probably terrifying for her. \n\nIt's understandable. But that's nature. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE KIDS IN THE FIRST PLACE: to make them into responsible, independant adults.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nYou are understandably hurt, and all this is rather devastating for your immediate life. I understand this. You should TRY (and it'll be hard) not to have the pain/betrayal/anger take you over.\n\nSpeak to her like the adult you are becoming.\n\n===============\n\nMom, I understand you are worried about what I wrote about suicide. As I told you, it's just stuff I wrote to vent. Nevertheless, if you want me to go to therapy, I'll do it.\n\nWhat I have a hard time understanding is that you are punishing me for starting turning into an adult. I don't think it's a guilt to have feelings for Jared. You approved him, you were cool with us having sex, but now that I have feelings you want me to break up with him? That's what adults do: have feelings for their partners. Please tell me what do you want me to do. Do you want to find another guy to have sex with, as long as feelings are not involved?\n\nThe same is for \"betraying your trust\". Did I lie to you? Did I hid from you things that I did? I am a teenager that is growing up and start feeling the need for her OWN space. Private space. That's what adult have and need. That's what every teenager has and needs, in order to find out and work out its real adult personality. Can't I have this?\"\n\n===============\n\nI know it will not not be possible to say all this in these calm ways. Perhaps you could write her. It'll e hard. She does not realize the is being overly projecting and controlling, and that she is jeopardizing your future relationship. Have her talk to others (your granparents, a counselor / other figure of authority ... for example, from church if you go there) She needs to speak about this WITH ANOTHER ADULT\n\nThese behaviours (i.e. expecting the daughter to have NO life unless it's with the mother) make me think of a narcissist disorder. Head to /r/raisedbynarcissists and see if the horror there resonates with your case. Especially the links in the sidebar (unless you are on mobile, and in this case I think the sidebar does not show, just google for the characteristics of narcissistic mothers)\n\nShe seems a nice mom in other occasions... How was your father? Maye HE was the \n narcissist, and  it's just FLEAS ? (again, see the sidebar or lookup up narcissism FLEAS ) \n\nIt'll be hard. But you are becoming an adult, and you can face that. You have to work this out like an adult.\n\nAnd Jared ..... That's difficoult. Talk to him, explain him the situation, explain him that you need help from him, and that your mom needs help from you. Do NOT tell him \"I'm breaking up with you because my mom told me so\" That's not what an adult would do. \n\nTell him something along \"I don't want to lose you, but please be patient. I need to work through this hard time, I have to do this alone but  I would like to be able to think that I a doing this for us too, that you are with me, that you'll be there at  the end of the tunnel\". \n\nThat's how adult partners speak to each other when shit happens. And I understand you now feel in a storm of shit.\n\nBest wishes. Be strong. Be proud of yourself. She should be proud of you.\n\nBTW: It's good for you to go to therapy, because if the therapist is a minimally reasonable  person she will help you through this with your mom. If you see the therapist is an ok person, you COULD try and have the therapist talk to your mom to detach you from HER baggage. SHE needs help more than you.\n\n", "A journal isn't meant to be taken at face-value, that's why they're meant to be very personal and private. Sometimes you need to express your chain of consciousness, let out all your crazy feelings and thoughts and then go back to look at them later and form a better context for your feelings and maybe learn something about yourself. It's a tool for personal growth. So for someone to go through your journal and then judge you for what you wrote, and even take punitive measures against you is more than wrong, it's unforgivable in my opinion. I've been married to my wife for 14 years and we share everything about each other. We fart in front of each other and babble nonsense when our minds wander, but I would never look through her journal unless she wants me to see something. Why? Because I know it's not something I could read and understand where she is coming from and what it means. Many times journal entries don't have meaning, it's just venting.\n\nEveryone should know this. Most people respect this. Your mom did something that she may believe is right, but it's not and it's very damaging to your relationship with your mother that she would violate your trust. I would write all of this in a letter for her to read and leave it on the kitchen table. Then tell her you're never going to keep a journal again because of this, and you will not trust her with your privacy and secrets anymore.\n\nIf she gives your laptop back (this is all kinds of wrong, this is thought policing) then you download [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/), its a free program for making a password protected folder on your computer that the goddamn FBI can't crack.

We get along so great and I have very strong feelings for him.\n\nMy mom is a single mom, has been since my dad left us when I was seven. I am an only child, I don't even have any half siblings, so I really only have a few friends and my mom. My mother and I get along well, we bicker and fight every now and then, but it's usually the normal mother-daughter squabble of \"clean this\" \"clean that\" \"why didn't you put this stuff away like I asked.\" She has this kind of skew mindset that all guys are douchebags since my dad was obviously one and emotionally abused her for awhile. (Not aware of anything physical, but I was young and they had been together long before I came along.) When my boyfriend, Jared, first asked me out, she warned me against all forms of abuse and she wanted to meet him. He's a great guy and she approved and at about the four month mark, took me to get the birth control pills. She didn't exactly want me having sex, but her exact words to the doctor were, \"I can't stop her, but I can at least protect her.\" Which is a totally cool way to look at it from a mom's point of view.\n\nI don't have a lot of girlfriends I can confide in, so I confide in this journal I have. I've been using it since July 6th of last year and try to update every other day. Sometimes I just rant in it or criticize others or my day, and sometimes I write long passages evaluating myself. I don't hold back and typically just let it all out just so it's not up in my mind. I keep the diary on my bookcase between a couple of books. It's a dark leather bound journal, so it doesn't stick out unless you're looking for a unmarked spine in the bookcase.\n\nWell earlier today, at around 8pm, I came home from the movies after a date with Jared. My mom was waiting for me, like usual, in the living room. I figured she wanted to chat me up about my date and the movie, but I noticed my journal in my hand and I immediately freaked out and asked her why she had that. She told me she was in my room putting some stuff away and noticed the journal sticking a little out from the other books. She said she was going to align it with the other books, but noticed it was an unmarked book and opened to figure out it was my journal.\n\nMy mom said she was shocked to see what she wrote. She couldn't believe I wrote so freely and \"let the hatred\" blind my usually good morals. She then went on to ask me if I was suicidal because I wrote like five or six entries about the ways of suicide and what it meant to me. I denied any of it and told her that not everything in the journal was true, there were stories I wrote in there, too, and I told her that everything in there was written at the heat of the moment. She wasn't really convinced, though, and told me she was throwing my journal out and was punishing me about everything she read about it. \n\nPunishments:\n\n1. I have to break up with Jared because I wrote too graphically and over romantically about our relationship, even though I spoke nothing of sex, my mother said she was worried I was \"in love\" with him, even though I've never used those words with him or in my journal.\n\n2. I have to see a therapist to discuss the possibility of depression for my entries about different times I was feeling blue and when I discussed suicide, no matter how hard I tried to tell her that my entries are over exaggerated because my emotions were fresh and raw when I wrote.\n\n3. I am not allowed to get my license now for apparently \"betraying her trust\" and not talking to her about problems this serious.\n\nI haven't broken up with Jared but I've been sent to my room and I'm grounded until my mom lifts the sentence. I have my phone but she is turning off mobile and I'm pretty sure she's confiscating my laptop tomorrow to go through all the stories I've written on my computer and to see if she can find anymore diary entries I've put on my harddrive (which there are none now, I deleted them.) I was going to get have my license in two weeks and my grandparents are giving me their old Honda Civic because they got a new car and I was so excited to have this freedom but now I won't be able to because I wrote innocent things in my journal.\n\nIs my mom right in this? Am I just being a whiny kid who doesn't know anything, because I don't feel like I can ever trust my mom again after she breached my privacy, read my secret thoughts, and then punished me for thinking/writing them.

Money from my mom's purse or dad's wallet. She'd sneak into my room and take things. Steal money from our grandparents, etc. We aren't very close because of this, and I always try to keep an eye on here when she's around. \nDespite this, I decided to invite my sister over because she doesn't live to far away, and I know my mom would have been upset if I didn't. I put all of my watches and valuables in my safe, but I left out the watch I had planned on wearing that night(but ended up not wearing it and leaving it on my dresser)   \n\nAt one point during the party my sister asked me where the bathroom was and I pointed down the hallway and told her the bathroom was on the left. A couple minutes later I went to go grab something from my room and saw her come out of my room as I was walking down the hall. She gave me this startled dear in the headlights look and said she was looking for the bathroom and walked away really quickly. I immediately got worried and went to do a quick look around my room. I immediately noticed the watch missing from on top of my dresser. This isn't some cheap $20 watch, I paid over 30k for it earlier this year. I left my room and went straight to my sister to confront her. I pulled her off to the side so it wouldn't cause a scene, and told her that I knew she took my watch and if she gave it back right then I wouldn't call the cops. She got extremely defensive and started yelling about how she didn't take shit from me, and how I'm an asshole etc. At this point, a lot of people were staring and listening us.

First of all, I tried to pull my sister off to the side. She was the one who started yelling at me and causing a scene that made everyone look over at her. I also wouldn't have had to go through her purse if she didn't STEAL FROM ME and deny it and try to leave.

She moved anyways, we've been living together for about 6 months. Things have been going alright, but lurking problems with our sex life have come to the fore.\n\nShe has a health condition which limits her ability to move her hips and limits sensation - that's as specific as I'll get. Otherwise she's very active and lives a normal life. I'm her first sexual partner, but she is not my first. Sexual contact and quality time are how I best \"hear\" the affection of a partner, I've always been a sexual person. She is not asexual, but due to her condition she simply doesn't enjoy sex and never has - best case she has minimal sensation and worst case she starts to hurt. She isn't vocal, can almost never finish (even on her own alone-time, due to a lack of sensation), and doesn't see sex (or being physically intimate) as a big part of a relationship - I always have. I always have to initiate, and while she will reciprocate it almost always feels somewhat forced on her part, like a chore, which leaves me feeling utterly terrible. I've communicated my concern about our sexual incompatibility, several times over the past 3.5 years, and she's always said she will try. My problem is that I'm not sure there's anything to \"try\". I don't want her to have to \"try\". I've tried to get her to open up, to relax and accept herself and be more sexually free, but when there isn't sensation it's just a nonstarter for her, which also means she almost never initiates anything and there's never any romantic interactions outside of the of when we're intimate - it's not how she thinks.\n\nMy mind has begun to wander. I remember previous sexual partners and I miss feeling physically wanted and satisfied, I miss having an actively participating partner. I miss the feeling of being able to satisfy my parter, and the intimacy that a good sex life brings into a relationship. I cheated on a partner of mine in the past, immediately came forward with it, and felt terrible - I swore on my life I'd never do that again to someone I love. I'm going to seek professional help but the waitlist for therapy at my University is at least a month, and frankly the therapist is terrible. I'm stuck in a shitty cycle of 1) feeling like I deserve a sexually compatible partner, 2) degrading myself for labeling my girlfriend (in my head) as sexually incompatible with me despite all her efforts and her condition, 3) reconciling with the fact that she has a medical condition and doesn't really have any control over the situation, and 4) trying to understand how to make things work or if that's even an option.\n\nShe is a possessive, so extra partners is not an option - and frankly not what I want. I want intimacy with my partner. Her mind has always been on marriage, but I don't see how any marriage can work without intimacy and satisfaction for both partners. What can I do when we've already talked this out and tried to address it for years long-distance, and now months of living together? Do I just squash the part of myself that wants to give and receive intimacy? Am I wrong for thinking that is a requirement of a healthy relationship? Are there other things we can do?

The idea of leaving her for something that appears so shallow, when we have an otherwise good relationship, ruins me and will ruin her.\n\nThanks for the help...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR! Girlfriend has a health condition that makes it so she can't really move her hips and doesn't feel much sexually - and her personality understandably does not weigh prioritize physical intimacy. I am very physical and always have to initiate intimacy - 3.5 years on it feels like I am a sexual chore to her - though she will never admit to it. We've always talked openly about trying to fix this, but nothing has worked. I miss the feeling of intimacy that comes with a compatible sexual partner and it's making me doubt an otherwise solid relationship.   \n\n\nEdit: Just nipping any comments now in the bud that suggest trying to spice things up in the bedroom.

I had that childhood but even just 7 years later the memories seem far away, like they belong to someone else. Bless your heart for giving a fuck about this girl. To this day, I remember that most people knew just enough about us to just think we were an incredibly well-behaved, if odd, family. But I do remember once a woman and her husband who lived in our neighborhood that we really liked, offering (in a really cryptic way) that if I (and my other sisters of similar teenage age) ever needed it we had a place to stay, we had one with them.\n\nAt the time, I was so damn brainwashed I was puzzled as to why she offered. I didn't rebel against the lifestyle of my parents until I was 18 and it was as if the scales suddenly fell off my eyes. I moved to a large city and lived among normal people, who my family had convinced me were all lesser, and amoral, and discovered the pack of lies and brainwashing I'd been fed. That said, I had been deeply depressed and suicidal since the age of 13. When I realized later in life that even just one person recognized the hell of a life we lived, that someone cared - well, it made a difference in my mind. That was one bright spot in a time in my life where there weren't many.\n\nI struggled with the FAFSA issue as well. First two years after I was cut off from my parents, nobody would provide me parental info. I hate the way that system is set up, it's garbage. Half of the people I know their parents didn't even contribute to their education. The ones who were in my position even were told there was no recourse. It was infuriating and upsetting at a time when I was dealing with a lot.\n\nEither way, thank you for your compassion for this girl. She will never forget it. Morally or on principle there is nothing wrong with what you're looking to do. I think your husband is wrong about \"undermining\" her parents. But practically speaking, if her parents find out and make her life hell or kick her out, are you going to offer her a place to stay? I will say that at least right now she's allowed to see and spend time with a normal kid like your daughter. We were never allowed to have friends because they might \"corrupt\" us. If Rose's family decides after all this that she can't hang out with your family or any normal people anymore, that would be horrible for her at that age where she's yearning for freedom. Just things to think about.\n\n", "First off, you and your family sound great, helping Rose in these regards is a wonderful and important thing to be doing. I'd agree with you that you should encourage and allow what you've posted about here. It sounds like Rose is in an incredibly stressful and quite toxic environment at home, and anything that you can do to help her out, let her experience what she should be able to, etc... is a great thing. ", "I think it's a good thing you want to help her. \n\nI suppose in doing these things you are undermining Rose's parents, as your husband said, but thats not always a bad thing. For example, if Rose's parents physically beat her and you allowed her to hide in your house til they calmed down it would still be undermining them, but that doesn't mean its a bad thing. I'm sure your husband would agree with that. Rose's case in reality may not be so extreme (at least physically) but I think her case justifies it.\n\nSome may say she should just wait a couple years to do these herself, but to a depressed teenager that would feel soooo far away. I really feel for this poor girl.\n\nThe most concerning issue I srr with this is that if Rose's family found out she did any of this stuff she would likely be thrown out and disowned. That's serious shit. If you're careful it'd probably be avoided but that's still a big risk.\n\nIf you go through with this I really think you should get your daughter to teach Rose how to swim when the weathers good enough. Thats dangerous as hell that she doesn't know how. Not knowing how to swim could actually kill her one day.\n\nAlso, if you go through with this just be sure you never ever give her alcohol while she's underage.

"], "edited": false, "id": "3vj0eo", "body": "Hi!\n\nMy daughter \"Lily\" is a wonderful, kind and accomplished HS student who came to me with a request back in September when the school year started.  Her friend \"Rose\" is from a very very religious, almost cultish family similar to the Duggars. Women are required to dress very modestly, stay home, have a bunch of kids, defer to their men etc. Sports, music, dance, books and pants are forbidden for girls.  Rose has 6 younger siblings that she cares for and does a large chunk of household work.  Rose's father is even employed by said church.\n\nRose just found out over the summer that her parents had decided not to let her go to college - by that they meant that they would not provide a single penny of financial support, not allow her to live at home if she chose to go to college (aka disown her) and most importantly, they would never give their information for FAFSA, so Rose can get grants and loans.  Of course, she would be banned from the family forever if she chose to attend college\n\nAs many of those reading this are aware, it's damn near impossible to get financial aid without FAFSA.  I work in the admissions department of the largest and highest ranked state university in my state, and Lily wanted to know if I could help Rose navigate this issue and come up with other options for her to go to college. Rose, very bravely, had decided to defy her parents and risk being disowned in order to get an education.  I agreed to help her and we have been meeting up twice a week (Rose made up a fake bible study group to stay back after hours, her mom just had a baby is quite distracted to even care) since then at my house.\n\nI have grown quite fond of Rose- she is incredibly hard working and courageous with zero support from anyone.  I enjoy our twice weekly meetings, when I usually make dinner for the girls as well.  Rose recently confided in me that she wants to try \"sinful\" things because well, she is a teenage girl I guess. Here are the list of things she wants to try and how I feel about them.\n\n1.  Make up - Rose wants to wear make up ( a strict no-no), especially bright lipstick.  I am ok with this because most teen girls like to experiment with make up and I don't think red lipstick will make her a whore.\n\n2.  Tampons - Rose is forced to use thick, bulky maxi pads by her mother because Tampons will take her virginity.  Again, I am fine with this because I don't think your choice of feminine hygiene products reflect your character.\n\n3.  A 2 piece bathing suit/bikini - This is a big one! We have a pool at home (too cold now) and she has seen Lily wearing and walking around in one when it was warmer.  Rose wants to know how it feels to wear one (she can't swim btw - her dickwad parents don't allow ANY sports).\n\n4.  Ethnic food - Our family loves Thai, Indian, Mexican and other \"ethnic\" meals.  I used to occasionally order in when Rose was over, but she always turned down the food because she was told that these countries/cultures were \"satanic\" and their food would turn you evil or gay or whatever.  She now wants to try and explore other food.\n\n5.   Wine - This is tricky.  Because I work in a college, I see first hand how kids from overly sheltered families go crazy with alcohol when they get to college.  My husband and I want to avoid this with Lily, so we let her have a small amount of wine with dinner 1-2 times a month. Well, Rose wants to try alcohol (also a huge no-no) with Lily.  Unfortunately, I don't want to risk giving alcohol to a minor and I plan on declining this request.\n\nHowever, my husband is wary of allowing Rose these experiences in our home.  He thinks that we are explicitly undermining Rose's parents and no matter how crazy they are, it's still their right to raise Rose how they see fit until she turns 18.\n\nI disagree with him mainly because I am already helping her defy her parents's decisions re: college (he is ok with because she will be over 18 when she moves out.  Plus, I can sense that she is depressed about not being like the other kids and it's definitely affecting her self esteem and general happiness. \n   \n**tl;dr**: I want to help daughter's friend experience normal teenage life, husband is not too keen on it."}, {"comments": ["- He doesn't respect your time\n\n- He doesn't keep his word\n\n- He disregards your health and grades\n\n- He's lazy about school\n\n- He's irresponsible \n\n- He's demanding you give him money\n\n\nDoes this sound okay to you?

I'm deeply passionate about the hotline's work, and I've devoted huge amounts of time and energy to answering calls, training new volunteers, and fundraising. I've become close friends with many of the people I volunteer with, and I get a lot of joy out of helping people who don't have a lot of other support in their lives. I love this organization; I can't imagine my life without it.\n\nToday, the head of the organization sent out an e-mail announcing that they've hired a new volunteer coordinator: the girl who relentlessly bullied me in high school and made my life a living hell.\n\nI was completely blindsided. I moved across the continent after graduating from high school, and I have no idea how or when this girl moved to my city. I doubt she applied for this job to deliberately antagonize me, since we've had no contact since graduation and all volunteers are anonymous. So it's just a terrible coincidence, but it still means I'm going to have to be working with a person who was unbelievably cruel to me.\n\nI really don't know what to do. Obviously, all of this was a long time ago, and it's possible she's cleaned up her act since high school, but I still hate the idea of even being in the same room as this girl. I've had her blocked on every platform for, wow, over a decade now. It looks like my only options are to, a) tough it out and deal with this person coming back into my life, or b) quit the hotline after five years of service.\n\nTL;DR I've volunteered at a mental health hotline for the past five years, and they just hired a girl who bullied me in high school as the new volunteer coordinator. I definitely don't want this person in my life in any capacity, but I also don't want to quit the hotline. What can I do?\n\n**Update (Friday, 7:43 PM EST):** Shortly after making this post, I went for my regularly scheduled afternoon shift at the hotline, and the girl just happened to be there for some kind of orientation. I wasn't expecting her to be there, so I initially just kept my head down and ignored her. A little while into the shift, she came over to introduce herself, and genuinely didn't seem to recognize me. (I've cut my hair and gotten glasses since high school, so that could have been it.) It was a very brief interaction, and I didn't say anything to her in return, just nodded and smiled. \n\nAfter she left, I asked my shift supervisor if I could speak with her privately. I followed some of the advice here - just letting her know that I have a history with this person and I'm not comfortable working with her directly. The shift supervisor was very understanding and said that she could arrange for me to only serve shifts when the girl isn't supervising. She also offered to let me schedule my shifts through her instead of through the girl, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, it seems like there will be an unavoidable level of casual interaction, given that the girl is working in the facility on a full-time, 9 to 5 basis. I think I'll be able to stick it out for now, but we'll see. The shift supervisor did ask me what I wanted to tell the girl, vis a vis an excuse for my not wanting to be on shift with her, but I couldn't think of anything to say, so I left it up to her.\n\nThanks for the kind words and the good advice, everyone.

I think it's because other than my dad, I was the only male in the house. I didn't get any special consideration for being the youngest (not that I'd want any), and anyway that was rendered irrelevant once my youngest sister was born. She was sort of the golden child throughout our childhoods, but my oldest sister also had special pride of place for being the oldest kid. I was the middle kid and even though I'm male I got hand-me-downs from my sister as long as the clothes weren't too effemimate. As an adult I can see how that's practical and moneysaving, but as a child it was embarrassing and also hurtful to see your sisters constantly get new clothes and new bikes, while I had to wear girls' clothes and ride hand-me-down girl bikes. Interestingly my younger sister never had to wear hand-me-downs from my older sister.\n\nMy mom and sisters pretty much had an easy life while my dad was alive because they just rode him all day long and henpecked him until he died fifteen years ago from a heart attack. He was only 58. Growing up sometimes my dad tried to do special guy things with me but my mom shamed him into stopping it.\n\nI just don't get it, why my mom was always so cynical and negative toward me. My hair was always too long or ugly, I was too skinny, then when I started working out in high school suddenly I was too muscular, then I was too tanned, then too pale, my grades weren't good enough, then once I got into a good school for college, it wasn't \"that good.\" When I earned my degree in business, I was a \"wannabe businessman fast food employee,\" when I got into graduate school for an MBA, it was a \"stupid idea,\" (not like I asked anyone to help me pay for it), etc. Why do you dress like that? You look dumb. Why don't you own a house? Your car is old. No one will respect you.\n\nYou know how that goes.\n\nI worked and earned my own pocket money starting at age fifteen with a job at a fast food restaurant, so that's why they all picked on me for working fast food. Eventually I became assistant manager of the restaurant at age twenty one, when I was almost done with college.\n\nMy sisters would often mock me for working in fast food, and my mom would too. It wasn't gentle ribbing or teasing, in a loving way. No. It was spiteful insults, trying to hurt my feelings and make me feel small. Speaking of feel small, I'm really tall (6'5\") and they also made fun of me for never trying out or being good at basketball or caring about any other sports.\n\nWhen my dad died he left everything to my mom, which is to be expected, including the house. He left me and each of my siblings ten thousand dollars just as some extra money, on the assumption that my mom would leave the kids everything equally upon her own death many years later. I already knew back then that my mom wouldn't leave me much, if anything, compared to my sisters. My sisters continued to live at home, but once I graduated college I moved across town to my own apartment. They weren't sad to see me go. I've been living on my own ever since. It's been going on almost twenty years now.\n\nI grew up in a rather large house (this was Kansas, where it was possible for a normal dude like my father to own a big home), so when my sisters got married, their husbands moved in, too. Their husbands are both college educated guys but I could tell they enjoyed the idea of not having to pay for their own house or any rent. My dad had built a small guest house behind the home which he always told me would be mine when I grew up, but after he died I could tell my mom had the place earmarked for her daughter and future son in law. My older sister and husband stayed in my former room in the big house.\n\nWell, whatever, right. I had my own thing going. These days I'm regional manager of a mid-sized restaurant chain (not fast food, but close haha) and although I'm not rich, I live quite comfortably. I could afford to put a downpayment on a house but I like the easy freedom of having an apartment. At thirty, I married my long-time girlfriend, who my mother and sisters always hated because she was Jewish and also eight years older than me. \"Your girlfriend is too old! She will never have a baby!\"\n\nWell, none of them came to my wedding even though they were invited. We actually conceived a baby but my wife miscarried. My mom and sisters found out about it and rather than express any condolences at a woman who just lost a child, my mom and sisters treated me to unsolicted \"I told you so\" and didn't send my wife so much as a card.\n\nI love my wife, and since we don't have kids, we have French bulldogs. We live in a big bungalow apartment with a yard for them, so whatever. My family mocks me for that, too. Like I'm not a man, because I don't have kids.\n\nIt's not like I accuse my sisters' husbands of not being men because they live in their mother in law's house. Everyone does their own thing.\n\nMy wife's family is somewhat successful in the furniture business and they're a lot nicer to me than my own family. My mother and father in law offered to buy me a new car (I drive a 2000 Honda Accord which is still in mint shape) just this year but I said no thanks, and they seemed to be impressed that I didn't accept gifts.\n\nWell, after all that background, finally my point.\n\nIt seems my sisters and their husbands have had all sorts of business schemes and tried to open their own yoga studio, because I guess my sisters are into that stuff. Sort of the whole \"Gee, I like coming to yoga class, so naturally I understand business economics and should open my own yoga studio!\"\n\nPersonally I thought that the kind of boutique, expensive yoga studio they had in mind was more of a Manhattan or Beverly Hills thing and not a small town thing, but whatever it was none of my business, they never asked my advice, so I never said anything. Plus my sisters' husbands both fancied themselves business savvy (one of them sells insurance, the other works as a new accounts person at a bank) so it's not like my counsel was ever needed.\n\nOf course they failed, and spectacularly so, and my mom foolishly put her house up as collatoral for the business. I'll admit that in a petty way I felt a bit of schadenfreude but overall I was upset especially because both of my sisters have small children (there are nine people living in my old house now).\n\nNow the bank is threatening to take over their house if they don't come up with a certain sum of money.\n\nIt's a lot of money, but money that I happen to have, and they know it.\n\nThey all approached me with appeals (by phone message and TEXT--they've always known where I live but have NEVER once come to visit me) to how I should be a good brother and son and how \"this is what my father would have wanted\" and all that. Neither of my sisters' husbands have said a word to me about it and I doubt I'll see one penny of my money back if I \"loaned\" it to them.\n\nMy mom especially has been laying it on thick about how she's an old woman and will be cast out of her \"familial home\" and all that. She's even gone so far as to hint that my \"rich Jewish wife's family\" can pony up the dough.\n\nI haven't yet returned any of their calls or texts yet.\n\nI'm still thinking about how they all always have a big Christmas party every year and never invite me or my wife, partly because they don't like me, and partly because they don't like the \"Jew.\" I know that if I confronted them about it they'd say \"you're family, you don't need to be invited, just show up,\" but I know DAMN WELL they don't want me there.\n\nMy wife says it's up to me whether I want to help or not, but she also says that there is power in mercy.\n\nI don't know, though. I think she's bigger than me in that way.\n\nI'm looking for some outside perspectives on what to do here.\n\nThanks for any advice, Reddit!!!\n\n\\---------\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR: my family has always been mean to me.

"], "edited": false, "id": "3knvuc", "body": "This is kinda long and I know that asking strangers on the internet may not be the best way of working out what to do but I really need to get this off my chest.\n\nThe first thing to say about my father is that he places a very high value on formal education.  He had very little of it himself but believes that it is the best thing that you can do in life.  I am one of a set of non-identical twins (with my sister) and she is everything that he could hope for in that she has a bachelors, a masters and has just completed law school.  Unfortunately for him (and me) I am not suited to formal education at all.  I did enroll for one semester at a state u but I knew from Day 1 I had made a mistake and left.  He was furious about that at the time and confidently predicted that I would be a bum and a loser for the rest of my life.  \n\nHowever, I found my niche as an entrepreneur and after struggling along for a few years at the beginning am now doing very well.  In the same way that I knew college was not for me, I know that running my own business is.  I have started and sold a number of them over the years and, although not everything I have tried has worked out by any means, the last one I managed to sell for a decent chunk of change (low 8-figures) and have recently moved across country to NYC to find a mentor to help me play in the big leagues.  Prior to this incident I thought that my Father had come to terms with me not going to college etc and making a success of being a businessman instead.  He and I have never been on the very best of terms but I did honestly think we had managed to get to a sort of \u201cworking relationship.\u201d\n\nI should add that my sister and I have always been close and although our lives have taken us in different directions we still speak at least once per month.  I always knew that she must have incurred a good amount of student loan debt over the years but I have never tried to tell her how to live her life and she has never tried to tell me how to live mine.\n\nMy sister got engaged last year to a guy she met in law school, I have met him once when they came to NYC for a visit and he seemed alright to me.  Fastforward to two weeks ago and I am travelling from NYC to our hometown for a \u201cmeet the family\u201d type dinner with my family and my future BIL's family (coincidentally, they come from a nearby town).  Upfront I will be very honest and say that I didn't really want to go as it is a long trip for me, I am very busy and what does it matter if I meet his family or not?  But I go, for my sister's sake.  \n\nAnyways, just before dinner my father pulls me off to one side, tells me that sister and BIL have a combined student loan debt of nearly $500k (WTF!!) and it would be really nice if I \u201cdid something for the family for once\u201d and paid it off for them as a wedding gift.  Frankly, I have been expecting him to ask me to contribute to the cost of the wedding and I had already decided that I would just keep my mouth shut and pay up so long as it was less than $25k, but this really shocked me.  It was the really matter-of-fact way that he said it.  Now, I have the money and wouldn't really miss it but that was not the point.\n\nIt gets worse.  As we are sitting down and eating it transpires that he has told everyone there that I am \u201crich\u201d and I will be paying off the student loan debt.  There are toasts and heartfelt thank-yous while I am just sitting there stunned at being railroaded in the most brazen way I have ever seen!!  \n\nLong story short, I said a few things I probably shouldn't have and end up walking out of the restaurant there and then and going back to the airport and catching a red-eye back to NY.  While I am in the air I am stewing on the whole situation but by the time I land I have calmed down and thinking \u201cwhat have I done\u201d?  However, when I switch my phone back on in the cab back to my apartment it just blows up with voice messages and texts from my parents and sister.  Later that night, my sister rings me again and this time I answer it.  I explain that it isn't about the money but the way in which it was just assumed that I would pay up.  I know that this sounds really petty now, but I was just so angry at the time.  My sister was really surprised as she knew nothing about it before the dinner and afterwards dad was going round telling everyone that I had said I was going to pay it but had now changed my mind!  She ended up being really embarrassed in front of her future in-laws (who are now wondering what their son is marrying into) so is now very pissed at our dad.\n\nNow I come to the issue.  Turns out my sister went back and confronted our dad about it and there was a huge row and now she is talking about eloping and not having a big family wedding at all or only inviting her fiance's family etc etc.  My phone is being besieged with messages from my parents to talk to my sister and ask her forgiveness so that she will forgive them.  The final message from my father before writing this was just him ranting about how I don't deserve the money that I have and it is because of \u201cpeople like me\u201d that college graduates are struggling.  Seems that we aren't in such a good place after all.\n\nI am not sure what to do.  Was I totally out of line?  I don't have many friends to talk to about this and those I do have probably have as equally skewed perception on this as I do.  Did I get this totally wrong?  Should I just have paid the money?  I hate being railroaded and that is what it felt like, as though my only value there was a source of funds.  Having said that. I'd hate to think that my sister's wedding gets ruined because of me...\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I have made some money selling a business and my father thinks I should pay off sister's and BIL's student loan debt as a wedding gift and blows-up when I refuse.

The apartment isn't that big (3 rooms, 1 closet) and we've checked literally everywhere, no square foot has been unturned. And yes we stripped the bed and sorted through every piece of laundry. We live in a very large and very old building, hundreds of residents. At this point we think it likely got into a crack somewhere in the wall or gone down a vent.

He apologized for being huffy at me, and for his astoundingly braindead idea about his niece. He said he was panicking and mad at himself for not securing the tank right, and acted defensive. Now that he's cooled off he realizes he was in the wrong. He knows he messed up, I told him if he wants an exotic pet again it MUST be a safe one.

With the combination of lucky genes and daily hard work on myself, I'm very aware of looking awesome (at least below the chin :P ).\n\nSo I\u2019ve tried to make my own selfies and videos - I\u2019d spent 2-3 hours daily for a few weeks to get the best possible with self recording, so he had least could show appreciation by having me on his screen for one out of ten fap sessions or I don\u2019t know?\n\nI remember that I\u2019d dress up and we\u2019d go out and he\u2019d be so proud. Now he\u2019s ogling every \nwoman out there.\n\nLike if he sees a woman with long dress, he needs to fap to porn of women with long dresses. If he sees a jeans ad, he needs to go fap to butts. If there\u2019s a blond girl around, \u2026 You get the gist.\n\nI\u2019ve begged him to let me blow him or give strip teases when he wants to fap. Not even every time\u2026 just\u2026 I want something.\n\nI\u2019ve encouraged more sleep and exercise, I\u2019ve overly enthusiastically praised him for having fun with friends. He\u2019s not depressed (yes, got checked out by a therapist and a psychiatrist, and he doesn\u2019t want therapy anyway because he thinks everyone should fix themselves).\n\nEventually I outright begged him to get better (I left time between each time I asked to not overwhelm him). In person, in voice messages, in text messages. I explained how horrible I felt. \n\nI outright told him \"I've been feeling secondary to porn\". I'v explained exactly how I felt, how he could help by just showing some interest in me... just anything, you know?\n\nA few days ago he said \"I still think you're attractive\" and yesterday he said \"Your selfie is nice\", but... that's all. That's all.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about fapping, I think, he doesn\u2019t seem horny at all if that makes sense. It\u2019s just porn, porn, porn. He\u2019s got things going on, a part-time job and some freelance work and he\u2019s dropping the freelance work. He\u2019s got plenty of friends and hobbies, so I don\u2019t see it being a cop-out for boredom or loneliness (I think it started as procrastination and got out of hand because porn is inherently addictive?). \n\nI\u2019ve begged him to find help/support. When he didn\u2019t, I figured he didn\u2019t know where to start, so I\u2019ve made a document with therapy options and helplines, that he didn\u2019t download or open. I\u2019ve sent to porn addiction helpline to his phone so he could just tap it to call. \n\n#I'm giving up, what now? \n\nI seriously can deal with not having sex. I'm a horny woman but I'm also patient and considerate. It\u2019s this horrible feeling of being unwanted, absolutely unwanted, by the only man I want to be desired by. Heck, even just disinterest would be easier to deal with than him actively choosing porn and pictures every single time. Everything and anything on his screen is better than me (not sure how to interpret ogling strangers?). It's crushing. I rocked this situation like a champ but the past three weeks it\u2019s finally become too much for me. Now I feel devastated, alone, I\u2019m crying so much.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019ve tried everything. I give up. What now? I\u2019m not ready to divorce, but I wonder if a separation would be good? Not to shake him awake, but for my sake\u2026 not being around him, not being confronted with him prioritizing porn over me or our marriage. Would that help? Because moving out would also rub it in my face how bad it has gotten. I\u2019m also not sure what a timeline would be before divorce happens. Do I wait one year? One year till what, effort to get better or being addiction-free? \n\n**I want to shift my focus onto myself.** What do I do? I'm in therapy, but we're discussing work anxiety (I work from home & recently botched a big project, that's been rough on me). Note, my husband is not emotionally available to support any other aspect of my life like work, health, general concerns.\n\nBecause it's an addiction , I'm actually not mad at him. But it reached breaking point and I'm suffering. I cannot help him. How do I help myself? \n\nI need to stop thinking \"I can find *something* so I can help him\" and focus on myself, because goddammit I'm sad and stressed and crying every day. \n\nI've not been wanting to talk about it with anyone, since it's waaay too personal information about my husband, that would be a breach of trust.\n\nI'm gonna repeat this for emphasis; I do not want to divorce yet. I will consider other drastic steps like moving out. Maybe small gifts for myself can help a lot too? Like buying a full-body massage for myself. I got some donuts, lol, but that didn't make me feel better. They were yummy though!\n\n**TL;DR** So yeah, while half of the post is about being affection-starved, my actual question is: \"What do I do for self-care, when feeling devastated that my husband isn't there for me?\". \n\n## Small update:\n\nEstablished a two-day no contact with husband in the hopes this can recharge my batteries a little.

What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n\nHope that helps. Im sorry for your loss.", "I lost my love suddenly too. So I know where you are. I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nMy advice is to grieve fully.

In the long term, think about grief counseling to start the healing process. \n\nBest of luck.  ", "Oh honey. I am so sorry. I've been where you are. I lost my boyfriend of several years when I was 23. We were building a life together, getting ready to move in together. I was crushed. So I understand. \n\nFirst thing, people are asking you right now what they can do for you. Your parents have asked, or maybe a sibling. The answer is that they can run interference for you. Ask your mom to return calls to friends and family, let them know that you appreciate their calls, but that you're not ready to talk to anyone yet. Same with email, messages, whatever. Ask someone else to deal with them for you. \n\nSecond, ask people to either stay with you so you don't have to be alone, or leave you alone because you can't be with others right now. You know best what you need. It's ok to ask for it. After my boyfriend died, I drank Scotch with one of my not-that-close friends and watched shitty funny movies. I knew this friend would be Ok just sitting with me, letting me laugh or cry as I needed, and wouldn't make me feel more than I was ready to. Maybe try to find that person in your life and hang out with them. It may not be the person you immediately think of. \n\nThird, denial is an Ok thing. There's a reason we as a species developed it as a coping mechanism. If it helps you feel better to pretend for a little while that you're Ok, then pretend away, buddy. The sorrow will catch up with you eventually. You don't have to embrace it just yet if you're not ready. \n\nFourth, think about seeing a shrink. Sometimes it can help to have someone to talk to. \n\nFifth, I want you to know that you're going to be Ok. You'll never be the same. This is something that will haunt you forever and affect you in ways that you can't appreciate yet. But it will also make you a better person if you let it. Life is precious and impermanent. Loving your girlfriend was a wonderful part of your life, and it's your job now to take all of the incredible things you learned from her and go on to live an amazing rest of your life. You owe it to her to live and love enough for the both of you. You'll be Ok, in time. \n\nWhen my boyfriend died, I thought that was it for me. I didn't think I'd ever love anyone as much as I loved him. That was almost 10 years ago. 5 years ago I got married. I had a baby a year ago. My life is rich and full in ways I never imagined it could have been. Loving my boyfriend helped pave the way for loving my husband, and losing my boyfriend has made me so much more grateful for the life I have now. I'm grateful every day, because I know how easy it is for it to go away. I never take this happiness for granted, ever. And that's the gift my boyfriend's death gave me, the gift of appreciation. \n\nSo hang in there. It gets easier, I promise. The Hurt never goes away, but the pain becomes less relevant to your everyday life over time, and what you're left with is that immense feeling of love and gratitude. It takes time, but it comes. \n\nI hope your healing is as swift and gentle as it can be. Pm me if you want to talk. I'm happy to listen.

I lived mostly with my mom, but spent weekends with my step family. Both houses were dysfunctional. My step mom used to have a severe problem with alcoholism, although she\u2019s been better in the last few years.\n\nRon is my best friend and I would be lost without him. We\u2019ve supported each other through years of hard times, and we discuss a lot how our lives could have been different if we\u2019d been sent to school or generally had a more healthy home life.

Ultimately our relationship felt like it had run it's course and we split amicably, however having many, many similar friends due to attending the same high school and university, we saw each other quite often even after our break up. Because we share such a large and similar friend group, we have many photos together of not just us alone but with all our friends and even with family. Many of those photos are captured moments of treasured memories that make up a large part of my not so long life.\n\nMy bf, Adrian and I have been together for 14 months, we don't live together but I do visit him at his place and spend nights there. Anyway a couple months ago he borrowed my laptop to fix something for me, when I got it back, that was it, I'm not someone who combs my photos often, in fact the last time I did update the photos on my laptop must have been February.

Naturally I called him to ask what happened to my photos because he was the only other person to have the laptop within the last few months. He said that while fixing my laptop, he found a lot of those photos and was very hurt that I had so many photos of my ex and thought it was disrespectful to our relationship to still have those.

Yes my ex is in a LOT of them but we've known each other forever and our families are very close, we'd been together for 1/3 of our lives when we broke up and still saw each other a lot after things ended so obviously he'd be in a lot of those photos.

I have two evening classes on Tuesdays and my teacher told us we would likely get out after an hour and a half so we definitely would not be there the full three hours. I share a car with my mom and so on Tuesdays, she drives with me to school, I hand it off to her, and she comes to pick me up. \n\nThat evening, since it was the first day, I got out much earlier and figured I would sit in the lobby and read for a bit while I waited. I was the only one in the lobby at that point and it was around 8:30 PM. I hear someone say \"Hi.\" but I just kept reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a tall man in sweats carrying a gym back a few feet away from me. I look up and he apologizes because he didn't mean to frighten me. I say it's fine and go back to my book. He then sits down across from me and I realize he was saying hi to me. He introduces himself as Gabe and says he works in the cafeteria and just finished his shift. I just nod politely and I'd like to note my entire body language was \"I'm trying to be by myself.\"\n\nHe asks me if I go to school here and I say yes. He makes some small talk with me before immediately launching into \"So what do I have to do to get to know you better?\" and I freeze a little. He repeats himself and I don't know what to say at that point. After some silence, he asks if I have a boyfriend to which I reply yes (not even as a way to make him back off, I honestly do and at that point, I wished he was there at that moment). He says he figured because I'm the most beautiful girl he's ever seen but I probably know I'm beautiful since I'm probably told that all the time.\n\nThat was my first signal that this guy was making me uncomfortable. He then goes on to say that he loves white women and how if he could lock a white woman down, he would be set for life and that he's sick of black girls because they're so \"hood\" and \"selfish\" as well as how white girls are so \"caring\" and \"classy\". This is my next signal because aside from how uncomfortable I already was, just how he was talking about women really rubbed me the wrong way. I look down at my phone and send a quick text to a friend asking her to call me really quickly. He keeps talking about this one white girl he used to date who was so perfect but he let her go and he regrets it. I'd never been in this situation before so before you ask me why I didn't just leave, I was just scared to be honest. She calls me shortly after, I say I have a call to take, and then leave as fast as I can. She asks what happened and I tell her. She says he probably just wanted to take a chance. I agreed to a point but everything about how he talked made me uncomfortable. I figured this was a one-time thing and forgot about it.\n\nUntil the next week.\n\nI go back out to the lobby the following week and there he is again, standing by the door. I go to leave and he blocks my exit, smiling. He starts trying to chat me up saying how he's sad he couldn't get my number last week and he'd love to talk to me some more because I'm just his type. I tell him I'm not interested and I have to leave. He keeps pushing for me to give him my number but thankfully with other people behind me this time I was able to leave.\n\nThe next week after, a girl I met joined me leaving class and we were chatting as we were project partners. We get down to the lobby and we see him again. She asks if I know him and I explain what happened to me. She and I walk to the door and he tries to get to me but she blocks him off. He says that he and I know each other and that we always talk. She says that she and I have stuff to work on so we have to leave right now. He looks annoyed at her but we quickly make an exit. \n\nNow I'm scared. I've already told this guy no so many times and he actually waits for me until I get out of classes. I don't know how to proceed or what to do but now I dread going to my classes because I'm scared he might just show up again and again.\n\n**tl;dr** - Guy hit on me in the lobby at school and I turned down.

Basically, I have reason to believe that my SO cheated on me last night at a \"company event\" with her boss. This event had been planned for a couple of weeks, and she was very excited to \"pick out something sexy to wear\". To a company event. As far as I understood, everyone else in the company would be attending as well.\n\nShe left for the event after work last night, and the last time I received a text was a couple of hours before it supposedly started. Beforehand, she said she wouldn't be too long at it, and would text me when she was leaving. There was inclement weather last night so I asked her to do this so I knew she wasn't upside down in a ditch somewhere.\n\nWell, several hours go by, no word from her. At this point, I'm a little worried. I texted her sister(who also happens to be close associates of my SOs boss) and asked if she heard from my SO at all during or before the party. She said \" her boss said that party was canceled because of the weather, I know he was going out to dinner with someone though.\" This is when my heart sank.\n\nI got nervous, and decided to open up her email and she if maybe she made any other plans around this time. The first email that popped up was from her boss forwarding her the reservation details for their \"Christmas party\", specifically they were meeting up at a couple of bars in a city an hour away and then heading to a very expensive restaurant for a \"very private evening\".\n\nAt that point, I knew something was up, but reasonably, there was nothing I could do about it, so I went to sleep. She got in around 130 in the morning stumbling around in the dark, so I know she got drunk or did drugs with this guy.\n\nI woke up this morning, and in the bathroom were her clothes from last night. I'm not proud of this, but I checked her pockets and found  nothing. But I noticed that her panties were bunched up under all of the other clothing, and when I picked them up, they reeked of sweat and sex. They also had, for lack of a less blatant term, sexual residue on them and obvious sperm stains.\n\nSo yeah, that's where we're at now. I never got the suspicion that she was unhappy in any way, and she even constantly complained about her work so I thought everything was kosher.\n\nWhat do, /r/relationships?\n\n**tl;dr** SO appears to have gone out and slept with boss last night during a \" company event\". No indication that she was ever unhappy in the relationship.\n\n\n**EDIT**: I posted a semi update in the thread, but here it is:\n\n\"I don't know why I really even posted this in here, to be honest. I guess I just needed a push to do what I know I need to do, which is leave her cheating ass. So, for that, thanks guys.\n\nI just don't get why she would do this. I've been the best boyfriend I can be, I've been super supportive of her hobbies and her career(...) and loved her with all of my heart.\n\nThe good news is she isn't on the lease and I don't pay for any of her bills, but her shit is everywhere in our apartment, so her packing up will take a while.

I'll be there from 12 to 1 exactly. Show up if you want, if not, it doesn't matter to me.

Thanks for tuning into the spectacle that is my love life as of late, folks.\n\nAs for the lunch update, it was not really as expected. I expected lots of tears shed, maybe some bargaining, but what I got was none of that.\n\nWhen she came into the restaurant, she was calm and collected. She almost looked proud, even. When she sat down, I looked at her for a few seconds and said \"Well, what do you have to say for yourself?\" What I got was more than I bargained for.\n\nIn a nutshell, she cheated because she wanted to. That was it. She wanted different dick, and her exact words were \"It got boring between us and I wanted something new, I knew what I was doing.\" I asked her if she got drunk that night and she said \"Of course I did, I got more drunk than I've ever been in my life ever.\" I asked her if she intended to hurt me and she said \"on the surface, no, but I guess somewhere deep inside, subconsciously, yes.\" I asked her how long this had been going on and she said \"last night was the first night we had sex, but we've been messing around ever since I started there.\" Which was a year ago. Good, just good.\n\nAt this point, I knew she was out for blood for whatever god forsaken reason. There was no point to this charade any longer, and I wanted out of there before I got hurt even more. I didn't intend to finish my meal, so I leaned over and said \"you have until tonight to get your shit out of my place, or it's on the curb, and I mean every last piece of it.\" And then left.\nHere I am at work now.

She then turned vengeful; demanding money, claiming abuse, and eventually went to our vacation house and family home without warning in order to take things that she wanted (not just her things but all of our baby pictures, fine China left to me by my grandmother, and things like our everyday dinnerware).\n\nMy father loved my mother dearly and he couldn't bring himself to leave her high and dry (though our state says infidelity = no right to alimony) so he purchased her a home, car, and furniture. She was basically living off of him still while also running around like a teenager. It made me sick.\n\nI had no desire to be part of my mother's life. My father never pushed the issue early on and he never spoke bad of her. He always told us kids that we were adults and could make our own choice to have her in our lives.

Got a lot of voice mail left and emails and even hand-written letters about how sorry she is about what she's done, but I never replied in any way. When it finally dawned on her I was really going through this and there was nothing she could do to stop it, she attempted suicide. \n\nIn all likelihood, she would have died had her parents not stayed at home to keep an eye on her. \n\nFrom what I've been told, she tried to overdose on pills, but no one knows where she got them in the first place. \n\nHer infidelity apparently became fully physical only recently (late November or early December), but even before that she was emotionally cheating for at least a few months before that.

Our son and daughter (the twins) did. They saw their mother kissing with the other man, in public (the place in question isn't somewhere where any of us usually pass through) and then they proceeded to inform me. \n\nI started digging around and found more than enough evidence of a prolonged affair.\n\nI don't have many dealbreakers, and believe that marriage is something that's a continuous work in progress.

She did ask me if she could live with me (the other three already have places of their own, by their own choice) and I told her she didn't even have to ask.\n \nI think that's the best thing in this situation overall, just having the kids there showing me not all of those years being with my wife were a waste. Whatever she's like now, I can at least be grateful for our children, if nothing else. \n\nI love them more than anything.\n\nUnfortunately, nearly everyone we know, barring the friends who were my friends before they became the family's, are trying to get me to stop the divorce and talk to her, go into counseling or some other nonsense. More so after the suicide attempt.\n\nNeedless to say, all those people are on my shitlist and I've cut all forms of communication with them. Sadly, that includes the in-laws, whom I've really loved before all this happened since I'm an orphan myself and saw them as the family I never had. They tried getting to me through their grandkids, which has soured them on visiting their grandparents in the near future. The kids tell me they love them, but they just can't be around them at this time because they're being so overbearing.\n\nThey've also chosen to distance themselves from their mother, though they're still in touch obviously. \n\nI'm in therapy myself, going through some counseling because for all that's happened I feel nothing. When I look back at finding out about all this, I see the lack of rage and hurt is very worrying. My therapist says I've numbed myself on purpose, to help me get through this easier. I don't know. Before all this, if anyone asked me how I felt about my marriage and wife, I'd probably tell them I as happy as I could be, with a big smile on my face. \n\nNow? Nothing. When I heard about the suicide attempt, you might as well have told me the weather forecast for the day. I didn't feel anything. Not for me personally, anyway. I was angry, in a way, as to what this could have done to our children, but beyond that her trying to kill herself just doesn't get a reaction out of me. \n\nI'm not happy that she's realized how much she's ruined our lives, but I'm not feeling any sort of empathy either. I can't. It's just that I look at the situation and think \"Yes, and? How is that any concern of mine?\" \n\nI'm not like that. Or at least I don't think I was like that before all of this. And my therapist assures me the numbness will pass, it's part of the healing process, but here we are, more than a month later and I still feel nothing about what happened. \n\nI'm honestly not sure if that's good or bad. I'll just have to wait and see. \n\nAs to the rest of my life, the friends that stayed true to me aren't letting me spend much time alone. They understand that I do need some time for myself every now and again, but they don't want me too alone. It all seems so different now, you know?\n\nNow, my main concern here is about our kids. For now, they're keeping away from her, of their own free choice. I didn't poison them against their mother or anything of the sort, they just don't want to talk to her much at all. Our youngest has been hit the hardest by her mother's infidelity, and I've been thinking of maybe having her see go for some therapy too, if we can't resolve this on our own. \n\nThis is what really bothers me about the whole thing, that our children reacted so severely to their mother's infidelity. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't glad that they did react negatively to it, because it goes to show that they understand that adultery is no small matter and that it can, like it has for us, destroy marriages and families. But I'm worried about long term.\n\nWill they get over this? Will they eventually form a tangible relationship with their mother? Will they heal? \n\nIf any of you folks have been in any situation as similar as ours, please share your experiences. \n\n**tl;dr**: Wife cheated, I filed for divorce, she tried to kill herself, and our children have been hit pretty roughly by all this, but they've supported me all the way.

"], "edited": true, "id": "53dse9", "body": "**Background:** I\u2019ve known my best friend, Nicole, since freshmen year of college (10 years ago). She met Mike her senior year. They married two years ago and have a son together. \n\nNicole is incredibly laid back, incredibly go-with-the-flow. She\u2019s friendly, bubbly, has never been high maintenance or demanding of attention. I was initially wary of Mike because he came off as undeservedly cocky and self-centered. One of those people that walks into the room while blasting his own personal WWE entrance song in his head. But he made her happy and he was utterly devoted to her, so I figured that was good enough. We\u2019ve lived in different cities since we\u2019ve graduated, so I only see Nicole and Mike a few times a year.\n\nAs additional background, my girlfriend and I have been together a year, and we just got a house together. She and Nicole clicked immediately, but she has spent minimal time around Mike.\n\n**The rest:** Nicole and Mike stayed at our house this weekend because the college football team they support was playing our local team, and they had tickets to the game. \n\nThe gf and I were bracing for Mike\u2019s tendency to dominate the conversation this weekend, but we weren\u2019t anticipating just how insufferable he would become. It was a painful two days, and I was glad to see them leave this morning.\n\n Some examples of his behavior:\n\n* **His football team lost, and his whiney attitude put a damper on the entire night.** I\u2019m a football fan. I get it. I\u2019m a bit mopey when my team loses, too, especially the way his team lost (They were highly ranked and favored and lost in a big way - if you follow college football, you can probably guess what game I\u2019m talking about). But he pouted about it - loudly and often - the entire night. The gf and I were watching the other games on TV when Mike and Nicole got back from theirs. He stormed in the door, immediately grabbed two beers from the fridge, flopped down on the entire length of the couch and ranted about the loss for a good 15 minutes. He\u2019d then flip between ranting about the loss during every lull in the conversation to sulking quietly while he sprawled across the couch, forcing Nicole and my gf to sit on the floor (We just moved in, so we\u2019re still short on furniture). The conversation could never last for more than five minutes without Mike interjecting his disgust with his team\u2019s loss. Funny enough, every time he\u2019d leave to pout in the other room, Nicole, my gf and I would get super chatty and have a great time laughing and joking. Then he\u2019d come back in, stamping around petulantly, interrupting whatever we had been talking about, and the general mood would immediately sour. He\u2019d talk about how inconsolable he was each time he tipped back a new beer or smoked another bowl. He told us a half-dozen times the exact scenario that could play out for his team to still make the playoffs. He even started ranting about the game to strangers next to us at dinner. Five hours later.\n\n\n* **He was abrasive towards all three of us, but most of all his own wife.** Whenever we ladies would tease each other, we'd all share in the laughter, but the moment anyone would say anything resembling teasing towards him, he'd get super loud and defensive. He'd throw a tantrum and Nicole would have to continually apologize or explain what \"we really meant\" and how it wasn't meant to be offensive. For example, Mike was raving about his peach cobbler old-fashioned at dinner - which was a welcome break from his boo-hooing about the game. I told him I'm glad he found a happy place, and Nicole mumbled something in agreement. He stared her down and said, \"BETTER? What do you MEAN I'm 'BETTER'?\" She looked a bit taken aback and clarified that she meant he must be feeling better. Later in the night, Nicole sat on Mike's lap on the couch and invited me to sit on her lap so my girlfriend could take a picture of all three of us. As I was attempting to position myself for the photo, Mike said, \"You're covering my face.\" As I continued to adjust, he yelled: \"YOU'RE COVERING MY FACE!\" then shoved me off of them.\n\n\n\n* **He made inappropriate and embarrassing comments about his and Nicole\u2019s sex life.** The more Mike drank, the more he'd switch between making passive-aggressive comments about his sex life and feeling up on Nicole. He'd talk about blue balls and needing sex and how he wished Nicole would wear sundresses because girls look good in them. It's like he took advantage of every opening he had to make a quip about their sex life. He also took every opportunity he could to grope Nicole, even going so far as to putting his hand down her shirt collar mid-conversation. When my girlfriend went to the bathroom to take out her contacts, she overheard him begging Nicole for sex in the guest bedroom. My girlfriend said the more Nicole pushed back, the whinier Mike got. \n\n\n* **He\u2019d lash out if we didn\u2019t react to something he said the way he wanted us to.** Whether it was a crude comment or a so-called sarcastic quip he'd make or his demand to go play Pokemon Go! the entire night (We played it to and from dinner both nights) or his inability to handle losing rounds in Cards Against Humanitiy, he'd make a scene every time something didn't go his way. He asked if we could go back to the Slushee shop we stopped at on Friday to get more alcoholic Slushees, and then added only if I \"stopped being such a *bi-atch*\" and drank with them since I didn't the night before (I declined, though I encouraged them to drink, and he still looked personally offended that I didn't want to). When we were all sharing bites of the side dishes we all ordered at dinner, he made fun of my braised kale (it was braised with bacon, for goodness sakes) and told me he'd stick with his \"shitty mac and cheese.\" As if me ordering kale instead of make and cheese was a personal affront to him. \n \n\n* **He single-handedly smashed the weekend\u2019s worth of beer and snacks meant for all of us.** I bought two bags of chips and a 24 pack of beer for the weekend. He slammed 18 of those beers and left nothing but crumbs from the two bags of chips. This complaint might be petty - after all, I did buy those things for our consumption - but I can\u2019t imagine being a guest in someone\u2019s home and cleaning out the entire weekend\u2019s supply of snacks/drinks by myself. The cherry on top came when he he polished off his second drink at dinner (his 12th drink of the day) and suggested that I might need to go out and get some more beer because \u201cwe\u201d were almost out. \n\nI realize there\u2019s probably nothing truly damning here. He didn\u2019t trash the house. He didn\u2019t clean out our whole pantry - just the snacks we bought. In fact, he actually fixed a leak that sprung under the kitchen sink while the gf and I were out for a walk Saturday morning. \n\nBut added up all together, it was an exhausting and frustrating weekend.\n\nIt got to a point on Saturday night where the gf excused herself to run to an ATM. When she had been gone a half hour, I texted her to make sure she was OK. She responded, \u201cI can\u2019t stand Mike. I just need a minute to myself.\u201d For context, my girlfriend has one of the most easy-going personalities I\u2019ve ever known. She also works in a customer service industry where she manages dozens of employees with different personality types in a high-stress environment. So it\u2019s pretty hard to faze her. \n\nLast night when we laid down for bed, we agreed neither of us would be comfortable with him in our home again.\n\nWhich brings us to the crux of the situation: How do I begin to approach my best friend about this? If she wants to come visit again, how do I possibly tell her her husband is not welcome? She would come to our defense whenever he\u2019d channel one of his micro-aggressions towards us, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re getting a divorce over it. So this problem won\u2019t be going away.\n\nAre my girlfriend and I overreacting? We aren\u2019t in college anymore. We\u2019re all either 30 or approaching it. In fact, their relationship in general seems pretty unhealthy, but that\u2019s an entirely different conversation. (Though I\u2019d welcome advice on that, too, if it comes to that.) \n\n**tl;dr:** Girlfriend and I hosted my best friend and her husband this weekend. Husband acted like all of the rotten children from Willy Wonka combined. We don\u2019t want him back in the house. Asking for advice on how to navigate what will eventually be a difficult conversation.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the replies, everyone. I appreciate the advice and the support. It looks like the concern here is less about addressing this weekend and more addressing this type of behavior in their relationship in general. I know from past nights of drinking with them that this wasn't a one-time behavior. He's acted like this before, only in smaller, less intense doses. \n\nI want to make sure she's OK and happy (if that's possible after what I observed?!). Nicole kind of opened the door when she texted me, \"Sorry Mike was so abrasive and obnoxious last night...I didn't realize he drank as much as he had,\" earlier this afternoon. My girlfriend uses reddit and has also been monitoring this thread, and we decided that I'm going to start that conversation with Nicole tomorrow morning - during work hours so I know he won't be lurking over her shoulder. \n\nI know that^ ^ ^ response might have seemed obvious from the get-go, but as I said to one of the commenters: Because Nicole is so laid-back, we've had a relatively breezy friendship and have never had to confront a tricky subject like this one. So as odd as it might sound, this is pretty unfamiliar territory for us.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**UPDATE:** I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to offer your thoughts and advice. I read every comment. Some of you thought my girlfriend and I could have done a better job standing up to Mike. While there were definitely some situations we could have handled better or firmer, I wanted to clarify that, overall, we didn't just let him roll over us. Every time he blatantly disrespected one of us, someone (whether it was me or Nicole) stood up to him. \n\nWe also tried to make the weekend as inclusive for everyone as possible. I'm aware that Mike was, literally, the odd man out, so we tried to accommodate what everyone wanted to a reasonable degree. Mike wanted to get alcohol Slushees on Friday, so we got alcohol Slushees. Mike wanted to play Pokemon Go!, so we made sure to play to and from our walks to dinner both nights. Other times, he wanted to do something that no one else wanted to do (like have dinner at 4 p.m. or go back for more alcohol Slushees on Saturday), so we wouldn't. \n\nAlso for the record, neither my girlfriend nor I hate men. It's just one man's actions in particular that rubbed us the wrong way. I got a good laugh out of that accusation, though. \n\nOn to the update:\n\nAfter spending Sunday evening talking with my gf about how to address this tactfully, I messaged Nicole this morning. I wanted to give Mike the benefit of the doubt, so I didn't want to jump to any conclusions about the nature of their relationship, but I wanted to be sure Nicole knew the door would be open if she ever felt uncomfortable with the way he talks to her when he's drunk (or sober, for all I know!)\n\nI wish I had a more interesting update, but the talk went how I thought it'd go. No earth-shattering revelations.\n\nLike I said in my edit, Nicole had texted me the night before apologizing for Mike's behavior. So I used that as an opening.\n\n**Me:** Sorry I didn't get back to you last night. But I just wanted you to know... You shouldn\u2019t feel the need to apologize for Mike. I do have to admit he made both of us pretty uncomfortable this weekend, but that is not your fault nor is it something you should be apologizing for. It was important to us you both had a good time, and I hope you did. I was worried if you were happy the whole time. I want you to know you can talk to me if he ever makes you unhappy or uncomfortable because some of the things he said to you this weekend makes me worry he isn't treating you correctly. I love you and I miss seeing you, and I want you to know that the door is always open if you need to talk.\n\n**Nicole:** What did he say that made you concerned for me?  Because I promise I couldn't be happier.  I think he just really wants you to like him, but he gets weird and awkward and tried too hard. Plus the alcohol didn't help anything.\n\nBased on that response, I didn't see a point in belaboring the issue. Even *if* there are deeper issues in their relationship, it's clear that talk wouldn't be happening now. But hopefully, there aren't. Hopefully, she's being honest with me and herself. \n\n**So I said:** Well that's a relief! I guess there were a few moments where it seemed like he made you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, but I'm glad you are as happy as you could be. That's all I was worried about.\n\nShe went quiet for a half hour, and I feared that I had upset her. But she eventually responded.\n\n**Nicole:** Yea there were a few times where I knew what he was saying was coming out totally offensive, so it made me cringe because he has the worst foot in mouth syndrome and doesn't realize what he's saying is coming out wrong.  I don't know why he gets so weird and feels like he needs to make jokes but it always makes things weird.  But you don't have anything to worry about with me.\n\nI didn't want to push her, though I was tempted to say, \"If Mike was really sorry, why are you the one apologizing to us?\" But I didn't. So there you have it. We ended up exchanging \"It was good to see you!\" messages, and the convo kind of died there. \n\nBest case scenario, it was just a really, really bad weekend for Mike, but Nicole is otherwise happy, healthy and whole. Worst case scenario... well, at least she knows the door is open. So if it gets to that point, I hope she talks to me.\n\n"}, {"comments": ["I think your brother needs to hear how fucked up his actions towards you were and how that made you feel before you get involved in your nephew's life.

My brother, Rick, certainly suspected from an early age, and made sure to bully me mercilessly growing up.  In high school, I started dating Mike who I married later in life. We kept it quiet but somehow Rick found out.  For the next 8 years he blackmailed me into everything from getting him pot to shaving my head threatening to tell our parents about Mike. \n\nThen when I was 24 I brought Mike home for Thanksgiving.  My sister was there with her husband.  Rick was there with the girl he knocked up.  I brought my \"roommate.\"  I had no intention of coming out, but I think my parents knew.  It was kind of a don't-ask-don't-tell.  Everything seemed okay until Rick started drinking.  Then everything went to hell.  He said that it was wrong for our parents to have someone like me at their table.  Because I was dating Mike.  Because I was a \"faggot.\"  He said he couldn't allow me to be a part of his life because I could be a \"child fucker.\"  He actually said that right there in front of our grandmother.  Then he told our parents to choose.  Me and Mike, or him, his girlfriend, and their future grandkid.  My parents asked if I was gay. Mike squeezed my hand under the table and I said yes.  They asked us to leave.\n\nSince then my contact with my family has been minimal, although I still keep in contact with my sister who reached out the next day.  My parents weren't there at my wedding.  A few years back, my mother started calling on Christmases and birthdays.  I let those calls go to voicemail. Needless to say I have not spoken to Rick.

It's a long, rambling letter of apology.  Rick says he now knows how I must have felt growing up because his son came out to him as gay.  He says he loves his son and wants to support him.  So he's a better father than he was a human being I guess.  And he says he wants me to talk to his son.  I haven't even met this boy.  I'm not his uncle.  I'm a strange gay man.  Sure I can offer him tales of overcoming bullying, but I was overcoming his own father.  I feel awkward about it.  The idea of talking to this poor boy makes me uncomfortable.  The thought of talking to Rick makes me break out in a cold sweat.  So I haven't responded but now I'm thinking I should.

We haven't spoken in 24 years.  He recently contacted me on FB because his son, who I've never met, has come out and he wants me to help my nephew. I kind of want to tell him to go to hell.  But I kind of want to help this poor kid.\n\nEdit: It was Thanksgiving. So much for trying to vague up some details.\n\n**ETA at 2 pm EST:** Thank you for all of the fantastic support and variety of advice.

I told her she was new and was put on our project.

She works at a very nice bakery and usually brings leftovers from work for us or people at my job. She always gave things out to everyone except Heather. \n\nEventually Heather picked up on the hostility and approached me to ask about why my wife was acting that way. I simply told her I didn't know, maybe because she didn't know her as long as the other colleagues she was distant. She seemed to accept that but would no longer leave at the same time as everyone else and would either go early or hang back.\n\nBryan, another coworker, approached me on Friday and asked to talk to me privately. He told me he had been at lunch with Kate, the coworker in question, and she had gone to pay for the food. She left her phone on the table. It lit up with a text and he saw it was from Valerie, my wife's name. The text basically said \"Did you see him talking to her today? What did he say?\" then \"Do you think Heather is going to stay at that job long?\" When Kate came back to the table he asked her if that was Valerie as in my wife. She got a deer in headlights look and said \"Oh yea..we text sometimes. We're friends.\" He said he thought it was weird because she put her phone in her purse without even checking the messages he had asked about and wanted to go.\n\nI went home and I snooped on my wife's phone. I know it was wrong but I had a feeling that if I asked her she would deny it or become defensive and not show me the phone. There were weeks worth of texts that basically were little reports on what went on at work. If Heather talked to me, what we talked about, did she hug me goodbye, did she touch me at all, did I laugh at her jokes. Did the guys think she was hot, did I join in with them, did I look like I was flirting..\n\nKate was also apparently talking up Valerie at work to Heather. She made sure to mention often we were married, how great Valerie was, how long we'd been together. I even read one that said \"I told her 'Val works in a bakery. I bet if anyone tried to steal her husband she'd just chop them up and bake them in to a pie, haha!' \" which was pretty fucking creepy. \n\nA lot of things started coming together then. Heather was much more distant lately, she seemed hesitant to say bye at the end of the day. We used to talk casually like everyone else at work but now she would just say hi and bye mostly.\n\nI've been sitting on this information all weekend. Today at work I could hardly look at Heather for shame of it, and I couldn't look at Kate for my disgust. I haven't been able to approach my wife about this because I just don't know how or what to say. I feel frustrated and very much weirded out. I feel gross too like I've had my every move watched without knowing it and as if just talking to a coworker is doing something wrong. \n\nI haven't talked to anyone else about this, not even Bryan who first mentioned it. I don't know what to do from here. I don't even know what this means for our relationship. It feels like something big has changed because I haven't been able to look at her the same way and all my interactions with her since Friday have been kind of forced and faked. I need to talk to her and figure out what to do.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I feel very lost right now.\n\nTL;DR: My wife has felt insecure about another coworker because they are tall and attractive. She has been texting with another coworker of mine who gives her reports on my interactions with the coworker my wife is jealous over. I feel betrayed and a bit sick thinking of it. I don't know what this means for us or how to proceed. \n\n"}, {"comments": ["If it were me, I honestly would run with the paid surrogate story. ", "HR needs to know about the betting pool.

I was raped and became pregnant.  I was not in any position to raise a child,  never wanted kids,  didn't know the first thing about having one.  I was worried if I kept him,  I'd see his father everytime I looked at him and I didn't want to risk him growing up with my resentment.  I didn't press charges because I didn't want the baby to grow up one day and search for his parents and find out that he's the son of a rapist. \n\nI didn't have family,  and I've always been a loner.  I had been working at a great job for about a year.  I didn't want to answer questions,  so I quit my job.  Ghosted the few friends I had made and pretty much holed up for 9 months.  I couldn't deal with anybody,  didn't want to explain what happened or explain why I didn't want to keep the baby.  Didn't want anyone else's opinion influencing mine.  Found a private agency,  went through profiles of almost 200 families before I found one I fell in love with.  And that was it.  \n\nIt was hard,  a lot harder than it had to be if I had reached out to someone.  I'm glad you have one close friend you opened up to,  but don't let your coworkers or anyone else make you feel isolated.

It'll make the whole situation even harder. \n\nOn a side note,  I had a semi closed adoption.  Any communication is done through the adoption agency.  The parents don't have my info and I don't have theirs,  but every 6 months I get pictures of him  and I'll continue to get pictures until he's 18.

I made this choice because the child was the product of non-consensual sex. I didn't press charges because I was a bit of a party-girl and didn't think I would be believed. I honestly have no idea who the guy was, I just remember trying to push him off and being to drunk to do so. \n\nMY choice to not press charges. MY choice to keep the pregnancy. MY choice to adopt out. I am comfortable with these choices. They are private and personal and I am keeping most of this to myself. \n\nMy asshole friends and co-workers have turned it into a game. I was hiding the pregnancy until I started really showing a couple weeks ago. I get that people are curious about it. It's rather surprising. But I saw a betting pool being passed around the office...THEY ARE PLACING BETS ON WHO IS THE FATHER! I was shocked and a little hurt. \n\nMy friends are also curious. I have one close friend who basically knows everything (she's going to be in the room for the birth for me) and she's not telling anyone. So, rumors are starting. One terrible rumor is that it's my (now former) friend Karen's husband Troy's baby. Karen called me in tears. I went over to her house to tell her to her face it wasn't it possible. She demanded to know the truth. I told her it was none of her business and she blasted me on fb. \n\nSome friends have been really nice to my face but everything gets back to me eventually. Some people are saying that I'm a paid surrogate. I guess that one is ok. I hate that people are talking about me like this. I made ONE blanket statement on fb yesterday: \"I guess I can't hide it anymore. Yes, I am pregnant. I am giving a lovely couple the child they have tried to have for years. It's very personal and private and I ask that you all respect that.\" It's got a bunch of comments but I haven't read them.

I don't like calling her (the baby is female) an 'accident'. The two people who know the whole truth (my friend and my doctor) immediately asked me why I didn't report it. I'm ashamed and humiliated. I really don't want to say much of anything. I think a big part of why this is so hard for me and those around me is that I'm usually really talkative and social. Loud-mouthed. I'm in sales so now that I'm showing I'm also dealing with these questions from strangers too. Should I go to my manager about the pool? Laugh it off? Wait for it all to blow over?\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I need to figure out what to tell people about my unplanned pregnancy in a polite but firm way that will make them stop speculating. \n\n**UPDATE**\n\nThank you so much for all the support. I'm glad I posted this. \n\n I had a good cry, took an antacid (or 4) and went to the owner, Jim. I told him the truth and I told him that I really didn't want the guys to know and I needed the jokes and talk to stop because it was hurting me. He hugged me and told me he was proud of me (which made me cry again. Fucking hormones). He gathered the staff and had a quick (what he calls come to Jesus) meeting. He announced that he would fire anyone who made me uncomfortable about my pregnancy on the spot and that all the money from the pool needed to end up on my desk, pronto. He was great. He didn't share any of my personal info, he just protected me and made it quick and easy. After we disbursed, he told me I could have an additional week paid medical (I already have 2 weeks sick/vacation I haven't used). \n\nI am going to text/talk to my friend and tell her she can subtly let people know what happened (especially Karen). \n\nThis baby bump is sales gold, I just landed a BIG commission *while sitting!* \n\nI still think, as great as Jim is, I need to get out of this town. I'll always be a trailer park slut to people around here. My mama died when I was real young and I acted out a lot after that. Everyone knows what I did and won't let me forget. Despite working my ass off to graduate, working my way up to sales lead, buying my home and fixing it up myself. I'm sick of Oklahoma. I'm thinking maybe somewhere in Oregon or Washington.

"], "edited": true, "id": "410uzl", "body": "Edit:  Married a year and a half\n\nMy parents (50s) couldn't handle the thought of empty nesting.  They adopted my sister and brought her home when she was four.  She's Korean.  I have two older brothers(27,29) but we only have the one sister.  We all kind of dote on her and kind of spoil her a bit but she's not a brat or anything.  \n\nSo here's the back story.  My grandma sadly passed away last June.  So she left her house and some money to my parents.  It's not a lot of money but the house is worth a ton.  My parents decided to make some changes on their trust and will leave my sister their house and, my grandparents' house which they just inherited.  They apportioned some money to all three of us boys but amounts to a small fraction of what my sister got.  The three of us were happy she's taken care of and talked about giving up our share for her.  But we don't want to sound ungrateful to our parents for leaving us something.\n\nNone of us have a problem with this.  The oldest of my brothers has two kids and one on the way and he got more than middle brother and I got because my parents name his kids as beneficiaries for some money as well.  None of us have a problem with that either.  We all just kind of hope my parents live a long time still, and we won't have to worry about that stuff any time soon.  By the way, the amounts are not much we're talking less than $100K.  The two houses combined are well into seven figures.  That's the only significantly large amount in all this.\n\nAs far as I know my two SIL's don't care either.  But my wife had a friend over and she was venting to her about her frustration with the way the money was allocated in the will.  I came home early from work yesterday and walked in through the back yard and in the back door.  I always walk in that way cause of how I park.  I wasn't trying to sneak in.  \n\nMy wife said she had a problem with my older brother getting more because he has kids and said \"we need to hurry up and have kids if that's the case.\"  I stood in the kitchen listening for a while.  They were in the living room.  Then she started about my sister and initially called her a spoiled little bitch.  Then it escalated from there.  I was frozen at first and didn't walk right in until the racist comments came out.  Her best friend's reaction was of shock.  She tried to calm her and tell her it's not as big a deal as she thinks.  She told her she was going over board but my wife just kept at it, getting angrier and more disgusting with her language.\n\nI walked in and asked her if she's felt that way about my sister all along, and about other races (we're all white American).  She stopped in her tracks and asked me how long i'd been listening.  I said \"all along but not long enough apparently.\"  She started raising her voice about my family spoiling her and doing her a disservice.  Honestly, I didn't hear most of what she said at this point.  I was way beyond furious and sick.  I looked at her friend and she immediately stood up and excused herself and left.\n\nI can't look at my wife.  I can't say how I feel about her right now.  She didn't take any of it back or apologize.  She said she chose the wrong words but that she's right about the point she's making.  She's always been nice to my sister.  But I didn't feel as though this was just a moment of rage on her part over the money.  We're not even going to see any of that money for decades (hopefully). \n\nWhenever called her out on the racist remarks she just deflected and said I was missing the point.  She says it's no big deal and people just say those thing when they're angry.  \n\nI don't know about all that \"people saying racist things when they're angry.\"  I know that it makes me extra sick that it was about my sister.  Not to diminish racist remarks about anybody, but I'll admit that I lost it in large part because it was about my sister.  So she went to stay at her parents and told me to call her when I'm ready to talk.  I don't know if I'll ever be ready.  I feel sick, like literally sick to my stomach.  I was a bit blindsided by this.\n\nI got an apologetic text from my wife's best friend.  She feels horrible that she didn't do more to stop her.  I told her I had no  problem with anything she said or how she reacted.  She did try to stop her by the way but there was no stopping her.  I remember her saying \"Oh my god\" several times, and \"don't even say that as a joke,\" more than once.  Even though it was clear she wasn't joking.  She tried to reel her in but there was no stopping her.  \n\nMy sister would be devastated because she truly loves my wife.  I feel sick and hope she never finds out.  If anybody in my family finds out, I don't know how my wife's relationship with any of them survives this when she's not accepting it at all.  She thinks it's no big deal cause it was just a moment of anger.\n\n**EDIT** Just want to address my parents leaving her most of the assets since so many find it odd.  There was a ton of planning done with a law firm.  It's not like they're handing my sister two sets of house keys with just a \"good luck kid.\"  They assigned a trustee (my brother) and back up trustees (my other brother, and me).  Everything from who gets custody of her to how and when she gets the money is spelled out.  As far as grandma's house, it's my understanding she explicitly told my parents (in writing) she wanted my sister to have her house (she had her reasons and we all respect that, and nobody was surprised by it considering how close they were).  So that's her's alone and all rental income is for her trust fund.  My brothers are well on their way financially.  I will be fine.  For now, my sister is the one that needs the most protection and security.  Maybe later that will change in terms of my parents' house or any other money.  For now it's how it is and everybody is happy with that arrangement.  We are talking about arrangements in case of a tragedy.  Hopefully this is something that won't happen for a couple or more decades.  I don't think it's a big deal at all.\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My wife made racist and hateful comments about my sister.

I worry that this mother is jealous of you for some reason and is taking it out on the situations with your son."], "edited": true, "id": "4rijqw", "body": "My son Simon has a lot of food allergies that we discovered when he was very young. The main ones are gluten, eggs, cocoa or chocolate, citrus fruits, and shellfish. None of the allergies are deadly, but eating these foods makes him very sick. For example, gluten makes him dizzy, he vomits, and he gets headaches, and touching an orange with his bare hands makes his skin itch and swell. Despite these allergies, my son is very friendly, outgoing, and happy, and he is not a picky eater, he will eat pretty much anything he isn't allergic to.\n\nI know not everybody is used to dealing with these types of allergies, so I try to be very accommodating. I pack his school lunches and send a box of gluten free brownies to the school every month or so in case a kid has a birthday and brings in a treat my son can't eat. I usually ask his friends' parents if they can sleep over at our house so they don't have to deal with his allergies, but if he does stay over another house I pack him his own food and give the parents a list of things he can't have. I offer to give the parents of his friends bunches of bananas and bags of cut carrots for when he comes over, but most of them say it is no problem and they just keep a few in the house in case he comes over. My son is very good at spotting whole foods he can and can't eat (like he knows he can have blueberries, but he can't eat lemonaid), but I still like to give a list in case the family bakes or cooks something with one of his off limits foods in it. Every family so far has been really kind and accomodating.\n\nMy son makes new friends all the time and he recently became friends with a new boy at his school. They have become very close very quickly. They wanted to have a sleep over a few weeks ago and I contacted the other mother and asked if Simon and his friend could stay at our house. I explained that it makes things easier because of the food allergies. The other mother said she would not be okay with that because there is no man in my house (I'm divorced) and she wants her son safe. I live in a very safe gated community, but I know some people are very protective of their kids. So I sent Simon over with a safe cookie for a snack and some cereal and almond milk for the morning. The next morning, the mother dropped them off and told me that she was unhappy about Simon eating his own food. She said she thought he should bring enough for everyone. I told her out right that most kids who are used to eating regular cookies don't like gluten free cookies because they taste different, and they're also very expensive so I couldn't buy a whole box every weekend. But I said okay.\n\nThe next weekend, Simon stayed over there again with a few other boys for a little Fourth of July party. I sent a whole box of cookies, more cereal with almond milk, and a big bag of safe oatmeal with instructions. The oatmeal is just certified gluten free oats with some brown sugar and nutritional powder, and you add the almond milk and stir slowly for maybe 5 minutes until it gets soft. I figured this way the mom could make them the same oatmeal if she wanted to be fair or she could use the cereal if she didn't want to cook. I picked Simon up the next day and he looked kind of sad. The mother kind of snidely told me she didn't appreciate having to cook for my son, I asked her what she meant, she talked about the oatmeal. Then her son came up and told me that he didn't like the cookies much, but he really loved the oatmeal, and he said thank you. (I don't know where this good is learning his good manners because it isn't his mother.)\n\nIn the car, Simon told me he was sad because the night before, the other mother had taken all of the boys on a surprise trip to McDonalds. He politely asked if he could stop at my house to get a sandwich that was safe for him to eat because we only live five minutes away. I guess his friend's mom snapped at him and said he needed to \"man up\" and find something on the menu he could eat. Simon was so embarassed that he sat there and ate nothing while his friends ate burgers and fries. I am not okay with shaming my son or with language like \"man up,\" so I called the other mother and asked her about the situation. She basically told me that she thought I was making up Simon's allergies to make him seem \"special,\" and anyway, \"It's not like he'll die from them.\" I was kind of shocked, so I said that I think Simon needs to stay home this weekend. Now I'm not sure what to do.\n\nAs a background note, my husband and I divorced on good terms a few years back because we realized we wanted different things from life. My husband remarried and moved to a big city on the other side of the United States that is very diverse and has lots of restaurants and stores that cater to all kinds of people. My son visits his dad in the summer and never has a problem getting food there, also, he mostly plays with his stepsister when he's there, so he doesn't worry about going to other people's houses.\n\nHow do I stand my ground with this mother without pushing too far? Am I expecting too much? Can my son still be friends with this boy?\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My son Simon has a lot of food allergies. I normally send him to sleepovers and school with safe food but his new friend's mother doesn't seem to think that's enough and is making it difficult for him when he stays over.

That's the *best* way I can put it. Her family was manipulative, controlling, and downright mean. Narcissists? Easily all of them, really. Except one of her sisters who is so traumatized by their family's social dynamic that she chokes up and cries if my wife talks about it. My wife happily overcame it and got out at 18. She shelter hopped while getting her education and made it all on her own. We met when she was at the highest point of her new freedom and I'd never known anyone happier. Knowing this, when we married she seriously nitpicked who was at the wedding. She has contact with maybe 5 people at the most from her side of the family and everyone else are quite distant.\n\nShe has a few on her facebook. They never talk to her, so she forgets they exist. So this is about one of them who isn't really even a part of her family. When my wife was a pre-teen her aunt on her mom's side had a high school friend named Jane. Jane had like five kids. All different dads. Not on good terms with any of the dads and jumped from boyfriend to boyfriend. They invited Jane on a vacation to California once with her kids. Not all of them, just the youngest two. Her daughter (Karen) and her three year old son (Donald). My wife described Karen as 'the worst'.\n\nApparently, even though Karen is around my wife's age (like two years younger maybe), she had this insane control issue and totally lacked a filter. She was constantly neck and neck with my wife as kids trying to assert herself as the dominant kid on the vacation. She would write lists for my wife and her siblings to obey, she would get mad and fly into rages if they didn't follow them, and even hit my wife's youngest sister (who has a heart condition) and called her slow and fat. Apparently that was the breaking point and my wife told me she 'calmly got up, dragged Karen by her hair to the door, and literally slapped her until she was out the door of the hotel room and locked her out'. After explaining why Karen wasn't in the room to her aunt, my wife's aunt just sighed and hugged my wife and told her Karen could sleep in her room so that she wouldn't bother any of the children.\n\nBefore the trip ended Karen was forced to apologize to my wife and used this as the reason, \"Sorry I hit your sister and yelled at you. My dad used to r*pe me all the time and I don't have a dad but you do so I hate you.\"\n\nJane turned totally red and never joined them on a vacation again. Later my wife asked her mom if that was true and her mom answered, \"Karen doesn't know who her dad is. So no, that isn't true. Jane doesn't let her boyfriends stay over.\"\n\nShe saw Karen later in life when they were teenagers. Karen calmed down significantly but kept bugging my wife to get her alone to try and help her search for her real dad on myspace. My wife politely refused and Karen flew into a rage and bit her. My wife slapped her across the face and told her to check herself and stop initiating fights. She called her out for lying about her dad and told her that lying about r*pe can ruin lives and to never do it again. Karen cried and ran to her mom who did nothing because she thought it would be ridiculous to harp on a teenager for dumb shit like that. After that Karen never spoke to my wife again.\n\nSo after my wife struggled through adulthood to get to where she is, she actually went to therapy and got great advice on setting boundaries with family. Now her mother and her get along fine and her mother shed her abusive behavior and is supportive and kind. My wife's aunt somewhat deteriorated and went through a depression spell (46 year old woman who went out and got inseminated for God knows why and has a newborn now) so my wife distanced herself from her. She gets along with her stepdad who was always pretty nice and she gets along with her siblings who grew out of their abusive tendencies as well.\n\nNow, beginning of March my wife saw something pop up on her facebook feed. An article posted by Karen. My wife didn't register who posted it because she doesn't usually look at the poster anyways. She just likes or ignores. Someone on the article was just being straight up horrendous and my wife corrected them on their behavior. She wasn't rude about it, and the person wasn't discussing the article anyways. They were using it to push their own agenda and ended up posting someone's personal information to try and get people to go shame that person for having an opposing view. Wife reported it and called the guy out.\n\nKaren, even though she was arguing against the guy, told my wife to quit being rude to people on her profile. Wife just laughed and deleted Karen and moved on. She told me it was stupid to get involved and she forgot she had that girl added and didn't care if Karen was on her friend's list.\n\nSo fast forward to this month. This week is my wife's family reunion. She was invited every year for three years and never wanted to go. This year she decided she was in a place with her family where she could comfortably go. She figured she'd use this reunion as an opportunity to announce our pregnancy.\n\nSo we're at the reunion freaking yesterday and guess who's there. Karen. My wife was a little surprised because she even told me that it didn't feel like her family really liked them anyways. The final straw was that last time when Karen bit my wife. Apparently in that same visit their family gave my wife's aunt's family scabies and they were deemed dirty and nobody wanted to visit with them again.\n\nWell I figured it would be awkward for my wife to talk to Karen and my wife agreed so we ignored her. She approached my wife, smelling like beer, and told her, \"I'm sorry for getting upset on Facebook the other day (month ago). You weren't being nice to my friends and I just can't have that. Being blunt isn't appreciative when it starts to hurt feelings. Hope you understand.\"\n\nMy wife just smiled and said, \"I'm gonna need you to leave me alone. I haven't seen my family in years and would appreciate it if you'd find somebody else to talk to while I enjoy this day.\"\n\nKaren rolled her eyes and said, \"Whatever bitch.\"\n\nMy wife just chuckled and turned to the group and was like, \"Well ooo-kay anyways!\" and suddenly out of freaking nowhere I see Karen move really quick out of the corner of my eye. Thankfully, my wife's stepdad was right next to her and grabbed her hand and I hear, \"Did you just try to break a beer bottle over my daughter's head.\" \n\nThat's when Karen starts blubbering and crying and saying that my wife was always mean and thought she was better than everyone else and her dad r*ped her when she was a kid so she only knows violence etc. My wife just rolls her eyes and says, \"Again with the lies. What a c*nt.\" and walks away and I followed. Karen was asked to leave with Jane and Donald and we thought that was the end of it.\n\nRight before my wife planned to announce her pregnancy my wife's aunt walks up to her and tells her she needs to leave too. She told her that using the word 'c*nt' at a family reunion was enough to get kicked out over and that she was always really standoffish to Karen and never gave her a chance. My wife's mom joined up and said it can be fixed if she just agrees to apologize to Karen and moves on from instigating fights with her.\n\nMy wife just downed the rest of her grape juice, walked out into the middle of everyone and yelled out, \"I'm pregnant. Cool huh? And nobody here will ever get to meet the baby.

One other thing is that tanning can be addictive and the way that people talk to you when you're in the salon reinforces the bad behaviour.

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this because it is about my relationship with my sister but my sister is dead so I guess it's a personal issue. I'm just looking for some help and advice. I'm posting with a throwaway because people know my main and I don't want my baggage out there for all of them to see.\n\nI\u2019ll start with some background about my sister: She started tanning when she was 14. School had just finished and she got a babysitting job for the summer. She used some of the money she made to go to the tanning beds. She would go at least twice week. She was constantly out in the sun too and never wore sunscreen. She met her husband when she was 20 and they got married a couple of years later. A year after the wedding she gave birth to a baby boy, my nephew. When he was a few weeks old she took him to the doctor for a checkup and the doctor noticed a mole on her arm that he told her to get checked because it looked suspicious. She didn't want to go but he made her promise to. She went to see a dermatologist and he was concerned enough to do a biopsy. It came back malignant and my sister was diagnosed with melanoma. The doctors did what they could to treat her but it had already spread. She died on the one year anniversary of her diagnosis. It was one month after her son's first birthday, two months after her second wedding anniversary and three months after her 24th birthday (to the day).\n\nI am so angry with her. I know she\u2019s dead so it doesn\u2019t make sense but I can\u2019t help it. The risks of tanning beds and the sun are so well known. My sister lived in a developed country, in a middle class home and she graduated high school and community college. No offense to anyone who isn\u2019t, but she had no excuse. I tried to tell her and so did other people but she didn\u2019t listen. She went twice a week and baked in the sun every chance she got. She tanned while pregnant. At first she didn\u2019t tell the tanning salon about her pregnancy and once she started showing she tanned outside instead. Even after she was diagnosed with melanoma we found out she continued to tan. She said she couldn\u2019t stand not being tanned. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I loved my sister. She was a good person, loving, kind and ambitious. Her death hurts like hell and I give anything for more time with her. But I am so angry at her and I feel like I hate her too. She left behind a son who won\u2019t remember her, a husband who she was the love of his life and a devastated family and many friends too. She worked at a charity and was always helping people. She could have done so much good but I can\u2019t stop hating her for wasting it. She didn\u2019t even stop when she was diagnosed. It\u2019s been 10 months since she died and all the anger and hate is still there. I\u2019m the same age she was when she died. I love my sister (if that makes sense) and I don\u2019t want to hate her. Please help if you have any advice.\n\ntl;dr My sister used tanning beds twice a week since she was 14 and she tanned outside too. She was diagnosed with melanoma but still kept tanning.

"], "edited": true, "id": "44qsw0", "body": "I've been a tomboy my entire life. I was sporty spice when I was younger, I was the father when my friends and I played house. My mother never dressed me up as a little girl so my wardrobe has always been pretty gender neutral. My humor is also not very *ladylike* and pretty much something you'd expect out of a dude. I've had many male friends tell me they see me as \"one of the bros\" because I'm not afraid to point out a nice ass or talk about gross things. Now, I DO have female friends, I'm definitely not one of those \"all my friends are guys\" chicks, my friend circle was pretty equal and I liked it. \n\nA reason why it was so easy for my male friends to see me as a \"bro\" is that I've been overweight almost my whole life. Once I started my period, I slowly put on weight up until mid 2014. I'm fairly short and was morbidly obese by the time I started losing weight. At my highest weight my BMI was around 42-45. It was bad. I dropped about 100 pounds in a year, which seems drastic, but honestly it was mostly from cutting out soda and fast food. It's amazing what that crap does to your body. By mid 2015 I was 130, with a BMI of about 26. I was still overweight and I wasn't losing weight as fast. It almost seemed like I had plateaud. But in July, I witnessed some fucked up shit that left me with PTSD, on top of worsening the mental illnesses I already had. I couldn't sleep or eat, and I ended up losing a lot more weight due to it. By the end of 2015, I was 100 pounds and had a BMI of 20. However, in reality I was severely underweight because I still had access skin and fat from being well over 200 pounds nearly a year before. \n\nRight now, I'm happy to say I am healing more and more every day from my trauma event and have managed to maintain a healthy weight (no more fainting or blacking out from going days without eating!) Now my problem is that my guy friends have been \"falling in love\" with me or trying to get me to have sex with them by complimenting the fuck outta me. I'm not use to this attention, considering when I was fat I didn't have many times where guys pursued me. Then when they get to know me and learn about my PTSD, I feel like they view me as a damsel in distress and become more attracted to me and the idea of \"fixing me\" despite me not wanting to be fixed... \n\nSo now I don't have many guy friends because they all become attracted to me. That sounds so conceited to me, but it's true... They like the fact that I'm small(height wise, but now weight wise also), that I'm a \"bro\" and not like most girls(their words, not mine), and that I'm a \"damsel in distress\" so I can basically be a project for them to work on. These are things I've heard from about a dozen guys since I became a normal weight last August. At first it was confusing for me, not being use to the attention, so I ended up leading some of these guys on. I'm naturally friendly with both sexes, so they would take my friendliness as more than it was. When I would reject them with no reason, they would get mad and stop talking to me. When I reject them and explain I'm working through PTSD but would love to stay friends, they would pursue me harder in an attempt to \"fix\" me so friendships don't work. I feel like I lose either way, but since I'm so use to getting along with everyone platonically it is really bumming me out and I don't know how to handle it. I was oblivious to the flirting but I think I've gotten a little better at detecting it, but ultimately I don't know how to maintain friendships with guys anymore. I've lost a lot of great guy friends simply because I didn't want to try a relationship with them. This is such a first world problem but it's seriously bothering me and I'd love advice on how to practically handle adapting to a new life.\n   \n\n\n**tl;dr**: After I lost weight, all my current and new male friends want some sort of intimate relationship with me.

I found my birth family a few years ago, though my birth mother had already passed by that time.  So I have some small inkling of what it's like to have a situation where you're sort of saddled with having two mothers and two fathers.\n\nThe first thing that popped out at me was when you said this about Hannah's husband...\n\n> and does not even have any blood-relation to me.\n\nThis isn't completely true.  You may not have his blood coursing through your body, and he may not have your blood coursing through his... but your blood IS related and connected:  through your two younger siblings.  Your blood and his flow in those small bodies.  And recognizing that may help you with feeling more comfortable with him.\n\nAs for the rest - my advice is to take things slowly.  You do NOT have to decide what sort of \"relationship\" you have with anyone.  You can take your time.  You can just glide along for a while and sit with the knowledge until you're ready to make a decision... or until a dynamic organically develops between you.\n\nAnd as strange as this sounds... nothing has fundamentally changed save the fact that you now possess more knowledge than you did.  Hannah has **always** been your birth mother.  Your mom & dad have **always** been your grandparents.  Your siblings have **always** been your aunts/uncles.  You simply didn't know it... but the FACT of it has always been true.  By the same token, Hannah has also **always** been your sister.  Your siblings have **always** been your siblings.  And your mom & dad have **always** been your mom & dad.  None of that has actually changed because those are the roles they have each steadfastly performed in your life for the last 17 years.\n\nSo give it all some time to sink in... and absolutely give yourself plenty of time to grieve the death of your mom.  I honestly think Hannah should have waited a bit longer to tell you, if only so you had plenty of time to grieve the loss of the only mom you've ever known... but the cat's out of the bag now, so that can't be undone.

Sometimes people try to designate one of them as my \"real\" mom, but they are both my real moms.  One gave birth to me and gave me my genetic identity, and one raised me and shaped my life experiences.  I love them both, in different ways.\n\nI think you'll have an easier time of things if you don't think of Hannah as replacing the woman you knew as your mom whom you are grieving.  She is every bit your mom as Hannah is.  Just take your time absorbing and integrating all this new information.  In time, you will sort out your relationships with Hannah and her family.

I have 5 siblings: a sister, 30; brother, 29; brother, 27; sister, 24; and sister 22.  And myself, 17.\n\nI always realized there was a gap between me and the rest of them.  The youngest of them was 5 years older than me, which is not that much older, but it was the biggest gap between two siblings.\n\nI had always figured that I was an accident, or unplanned.  That my parents were done having kids after my last sister, but then I came along and was completely unplanned, hence the big gap.\n\nBeing the youngest, even though I felt distant from the rest of them, I felt spoiled all the time.  The way they treated me was how you would expect they would treat the youngest, they nurtured me, and I was often the center of attention.  I did like it.  I wouldn't get as much respect but I would get priority from my siblings over each other in many things.  I was the cute one; I was the precious one; I was the one they always wanted to side with them when they'd have an argument with each other.\n\nMy oldest sister, Hannah, always took care of me the best.  I always saw her as a mother figure, never knowing she was actually my mother.  She always spent the most time with me out of all my brothers and sisters, took care of me the best, and was often there for me when my mom wasn't.\n\nMy parents were much older than me, and I had always felt more distant from them than from my siblings.  As I said, Hannah, was in many ways a mother-figure towards me in the way that our mother was lacking.\n\nWhen my father passed away, it was probably the worst part of my life.  I was really young, around 8 years old.  I did not take it well at all.  I cried for weeks, I went crazy, I threw fits at people.  I reacted poorly and negatively towards everyone.  I know my siblings were all going through just as bad a period, but I made it about me.  I didn't even consider them or what they would have been going through emotionally, despite them being there constantly for me.\n\nAnd recently the same thing happened with mom.  It hit me just as hard, if not harder.  She'd been sick for a long time and slowly getting worse.  Even though I'd lost one parent already and am older, I wasn't at all ready for it when it hit me.\n\nIt was after this that Hannah told me the truth.  She sat me down, and braced me that what she was about to tell me would be a shock.  She knew that we were all still recovering from our mother's passing, but a few weeks had passed, and she felt it was enough time to wait before coming out with the truth.  She said she had always wanted to tell me, and only now could she finally.\n\nWhen she was 13, as many stupid kids do, she had unprotected sex with a boy, and she had gotten pregnant. And that child was me.  At the time her parents had wanted her to give the baby away for adoption, but she was unshakable and wanted to keep her child.  She completely refused to give me, her son, away.\n\nThey eventually agreed to keep me, and would raise me in their household, but with her parents as the guardians, and I would grow up thinking they were my real parents.  Apparently, some of my older 'siblings' also knew, but they never mentioned it.  In fact, they are my aunts and uncles.\n\nMy mother had made Hannah swear she would never tell me.  When mom got sick, Hannah had approached her and plead with her to relieve her of this burden, because she really wanted to tell me.  My mother had agreed that she could tell me only after some time passed after her death, she wanted to die as my mother, not grandmother.\n\nHannah said all my life she had wanted to tell me, but had sworn not to.  There were many times where she felt like she had to tell me, but had held herself back.  Now, she was finally glad she was able to tell me the truth she had always wanted to: that I am her son.\n\nI was taken back completely, I had no idea how to react.  In some strange mysterious way, I kind of had always seen her in a more motherly light than my actual mother.  The level of reliance and nurture that was there was much more of a maternal relationship than a fraternal one.\n\nHannah told me now that I knew, she can finally be my mother openly.  I don't know how to feel about that, I just lost my mother, but now I already have a new one, who is in fact my real one.\n\nHannah is 30 and I'm 17, and in my mom's will, she had given custody over me for the last year before I turn 18 to Hannah.\n\nHannah is married and has children in fact, a boy and a girl, 6 and 5.  Her husband is 33, I guess he's now my step-dad?\n\nI had no idea how to respond.  She said she finally had the chance now to raise me as her son, the way it was always meant to be.  I told her I couldn't refer to her as 'mom', it wouldn't feel natural and I just wasn't ready yet, so I'll keep calling her 'Hannah', but I am really glad she told me the truth.  I don't blame her for hiding it this long, it wasn't her fault.  But I'm glad I now know.\n\nI went and spoke with my nephew and niece, in reality my half-brother and half-sister, and me and Hannah explained to them the reality.  They seemed to understand, as best they could.  It kind of shocked them as well, but not nearly as much as it did me.  I sat down with them, I hugged them, I kissed them, I cried.  They asked me why I was crying, I said I don't know.  Telling my half-brother and half-sister how we were really related moved me much more than it did them.  I know now for certain I will always be much closer to them and try to be a more present force in their lives.\n\nI spoke with Hannah's husband, he shook my hand and told me he was proud of me.  He gave me a hug, and told me that he wants to be the main man in my life, and would always be there, and I could come to him whenever I needed anything.  I could tell he was trying to place himself as a father figure towards me, but I don't know if I can accept that.  He's not my father, just happens to be the husband of my biological mother, and does not even have any blood-relation to me.  He's not even that much older, neither is Hannah.  Its weird to see them as parents in any way.\n\nHannah is really prepared to make this an actual thing, her my mother, me her son.  I was sitting with her family on the couch, when she told me they were ready to be my full family, and she wanted it that way.  She hugged me and didn't let go for so long, I can't imagine what it must have felt like to her.  Finally getting her son back, the son she had been forced to hide from for so long.  She said she was now glad more than ever that she had kept me when I was born, and was absolutely confident it was the right choice.\n\nShe asked me why I was being so quiet and had not said much, but she understood why this would be something really heavy to come to grips with.  I didn't like how her husband was there, I never really identified with him, and I didn't see why he needed to be present for this revelation.  I told her I would like to speak with her privately elsewhere, so we went elsewhere in the house.\n\nShe told me \"I know this is very heavy for you, if you want to be left alone, I understand.  If you just want to continue our relationship the way it was before, I understand.  But you have to know, you do have a mother still, and she loves you, and she will always be there for you.  Never ever feel like you don't have a home to go to.\"  She then hugged me and I couldn't hold back my tears any more, I buried my face against her chest and let out all the tears; she held my head and hushed me, telling me it would all be okay.   She said I'm finally at my real home, and I had nothing to be afraid of.\n\nBut I am afraid.  I don't know where I belong.  I have so many fears and apprehensions.  I just lost the only mother I had ever known, I don't know if I can ever accept a second one.  But part of it feels right, like she said, that things are finally corrected.  Personally, I just wish I had known the truth earlier.  But I always felt a stronger connection with her than with any of my other siblings.  She was always my biological mother, nothing can change that.  But does that make her my real mother? Can I accept her as that?  Can I accept this new 'home' as she calls it, can I accept this new family?  I don't even know what real mother means.  Maybe I'm seeing things I'm not meant to see; maybe I'm so devastated and distraught from the death of my mother, I'm willing to give the mantle piece of mother over to Hannah just to lessen the blow of losing a mother, so I tell myself I still have one.  Even if biological mother does not equal real mother, she definitely wants to take on the role of the real mother.  And I do have one year left before I'm an adult, so she's effectively my guardian and parent until then.\n\n---   \n**tl;dr: Grew up youngest in a family of six, father passed away when I was young, mother recently passed away.

I started to realize that he looked familiar and ask if we went to elementary school together or if he attended my church as a kid. He said he just moved to the state a couple years ago and I chalked it up as him having \"one of those\" faces.\n\n\nWe started chatting and hit it off pretty quickly. I told him I wasn't big into social media and he said he wasn't either so we exchanged numbers and started texting to communicate. Even though he lived an hour away he commutes to my town a lot for work and since neither of us were looking for anything serious we figured this was a pretty awesome set up. After a while our conversations turned a bit sexual with some sexy pics being sent from his side and comments about hooking up when he came back. We set up a date to have lunch and meet when he got back.\n\n\nDuring this time I had told Anna all about him and when I finally told her we were going to meet up she asked for a picture. I sent her one (not one of the sexy ones, obviously) and was surprised to find out that she had dated him for a short time (couple of weeks) a few years back. I asked if she was okay with me seeing him and she said she didn't care but that she was positive he had a girlfriend. She sent me his full name so I could find him on Facebook and sure enough he was in a relationship. I was pissed.\n\n\nI instantly sent him a message confronting him. He apologized and profusely and said it was a mistake to talk to me on Tinder. I told him he should be apologizing to his girlfriend which he begged me not to tell. I told him to fuck off and blocked his number.\n\n\nAfter that I screenshot all the messages we had sent including him admitting to his guilt and sent his girlfriend a Facebook message. I told her I felt awful for having even a small role in his potential infidelity and that I thought she should know. I haven't gotten a message back and I don't think I will. But I felt what I did was the right thing to do.\n\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago when I came back home and went out for lunch with Anna. She asked me what ending up happening with John and I told her. She instantly got furious and started saying stuff like I had \"no business interfering with another person's relationship\" and \"how could I destroy a relationship I wasn't part of.\" I got really defensive and told her that he *made* me part of their relationship when he tried to cheat on his girlfriend with me. She told me I was disgusting and an awful person for what I did and that I had no business messaging John's girlfriend then paid and left. She hasn't talked to me since.\n\n\nI feel like I did the right thing but the way Anna reacted and how she refuses to talk to me anymore is making me question everything. Was I right to get involved and message his girlfriend? How can I get Anna to talk to me again?\n\n\n**TL;DR**: Met a guy on Tinder, turns out he had a girlfriend, message his girlfriend with screenshots and told her, best friend thinks I shouldn't have meddled and that I'm awful for doing so and won't talk to me. Did I do the right thing? How do I get my best friend to talk to me again?\n\n\n\n"}, {"comments": [">about a month ago, and me and my SO hardly talk at all.

So i've been with my SO for 7 years, lived together for 6, we have our ups and downs like every other couple, however these last few months have been more than I can bear.\n\nIt started 5 months ago when my SO got an unexpected phone call from her cousin who she hadn't heard from in years saying that she needed to get out of the town she lived in, needed a fresh start. Yadayadayada. My SO said yes first, then asked me, putting me in a position where if I said no I would look like a total ass.\n\nAnyway I said yes on the condition that she pay a third rent, a third utilities and a third food. This didn't happen from the get go, instead it she paid nothing for food, nothing for utilities and paid rent sporadicly in whatever amount she felt like. \n\nThis happened for the first month that she was there. At about this time I started asking both my girlfriend and the cousin about rent etc. The response was that the cousin was in massive debt and couldn't afford to pay. By this time the cousin had got a job paying more than I do (I'm a student working part time). So my response, was 'bullshit its not my responsibility to bore the burden of her debt'. \nIt was about this time that my girlfriend started being manipulated by her cousin and began growing distant, hanging out with the cousin more, and so on.\n\nFast forward to about a month ago, and me and my SO hardly talk at all. My SO and her cousin hang out in what ever room i'm not in and when we do hang out the cousin manipulates the conversations we have into fights that don't get resolved, making the situation worse. I've tried to tell my SO that she is being manipulated, but she shrugs it off claiming I'm being an asshole, as the cousin is a master at putting on a nice front.\n\nLast week I started staying at my folks house, because I was tired of being in a relationship where I was totally alone. I haven't even received even so much as a text from my SO since. \n\nI've talked to our friends about it and they have told me i've gotta kick the bitch out. I'm thinking of leaving as I can't see myself marrying my SO due to the lack of loyalty that I've received from her during this period.     \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My SO's cousin moved in and destroyed my relationship by manipulating my SO over the course of 5 months, should I stay or should I go? \n\nEDIT: So I don't know if this changes much, but my SO kicks in half for everything she is pretty good in terms of paying her own way, it's pretty much the cousin who is the drain in all this.\n\nEDIT 2: thanks for all of the responses i'm going to give my SO a call and go my own way, it was good to get an outside perspective on the whole deal.\n\nEDIT 3: I'm gonna call tonight and post the update tomorrow as i'm gonna get properly wasted afterward. I will keep you all posted, thanks for all of the advice, it means a lot. \n\nUPDATE: So I went round to the house last night because I feel that talking over the phone for something of this magnitude was a bit soft. Basically I aired my grievances and she completely agreed. Going on I said that I would be moving out over the next week and I don't think she grasped the gravity of the situation because she didn't seem to care. Any way after I said my piece I got absolutely wankered at the pub and while I was there I ran into my brother who i'm pretty close to. Turns out his room mate is moving interstate and he was looking for someone to share a house with, so he hit me up to move in. \n\nI can't say that i'm completely happy as I was really looking to get married and start having kids within the space of the next 18 months and i'm kinda scared that it might not even happen considering i'm leaving my run a little bit late on a count of my age. I do however have the feeling that a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders, that and a massive hangover that is gonna stay with me all day.

If you start off with small questions about their weekend plans, their dog, any planned holidays, (all the usual small talk stuff) and really engage with the topic, you will naturally start to build up a level of comfort and familiarity.\n\nAlso it is important not to read too much into what people do - e.g. they wait for you because they want to and they're not inconvenienced by it. If they had somewhere to be then they would be there already.\n\nHopefully this makes a little sense.

Don't feel like you are weird if you don't want to be the extroverted centre of the group - circles of friends need all sorts of people :)", "this is so exciting!! a few suggestions - if you're worried about being boring, ask questions, or just listen. if you are stressed about chiming in with thoughts, stray on the side of positive - e.g. compliments, optimism, comfort. You seem like a really sweet person so that shouldn't be too hard. You don't need to talk as much as everyone else if you don't want to - no one will think you're boring because of that, more likely they'll think you're a good listener. \n\nAlso, when you feel more comfortable with them, consider opening up a little too. You can let them know you can get really anxious in social situations, so the fact they included you (as the new person) made you happy. Not everyone goes out of their way to do that, so letting them know appreciate that they did will likely make them feel good. I've advanced a lot of friendships just by opening up with how much I like the other person - not easy for me because being verbally affectionate makes me uncomfortable. People like the positive feedback (as I'm sure you can imagine).\n\nTake the initiative to suggest hanging out too sometimes, instead of just tagging along. Have them over for dinner and games sometime or suggest a new restaurant to try. It's nice to know the effort is a two way street. \n\nGood luck!

You may not know how rare and valuable you are in a professional setting.\n\nThe advice you've received in this thread about listening and asking questions is right on. If you ask people about their *perceptions* of things (\"So how did you like that movie?\") instead of probing for *data about their lives* (\"So how much do you spend on groceries in a week?\"), that is not creepy, that is fun and engaged and people will welcome it.\n\nSome basic small-talk starters that will always reflect well on you:\n\n* \"Guys, I need to replace X at home (something small and unimpressive: garbage disposal, coffee maker, etc.). Any input? What do you like?\"\n* \"I have a friend / parents / etc. coming to town next weekend, and I want show them around. Where would you recommend?\"\n* \"Winter is coming and we'll have some bad weather days, I'm sure. Do you guys adjust your commute when that happens? Any advice?\"\n* \"So, have you always lived in [this city]? Born and bred? I'd love to hear your back story.\"\n\nAnd so on. Stay away from politics, religion, sex / relationships, comment on current news (\"Hey, the Pope is really digging himself a hole on this sex abuse thing, amirite?\" -- Don't do that) -- at least until you know them *really* well. And when your workmates ask you benign, interested questions, assume it is because they like you, and you deserve to be liked, and answer happily -- it is a compliment!\n\nYou will do great.

I live with 2 roommates in a single room, Jess and Lisa. We're friendly with each other, but I'm not close friends with them. They're best friends with each other though. The floor I'm living on has girls and guys on it, girls in the north wing and guys in the south wing. The hallways of each wing open into a large lounge, which separates the girls and guys rooms. \n\n A lot of people on our floor go out and party every weekend (Thursday through Saturday) and while they can be a little annoying when they come back drunk and wake us up, my roommates and I don't really have anything against them.\n\nYesterday, late Thursday night, my roommates and I were woken up at 3 am by screaming in the lounge. Along with most of the floor, we got up and wandered over to the lounge to see what was going on. We were pretty annoyed because we were tired. I even had a test the next morning, in bio, and I had hoped to get a good night sleep. \n\nTwo really drunk guys from my dorm were shouting at each other; one had apparently insulted the other and they were freaking the hell out at each other. Basically yelling about how they were gonna kick each others asses, but not actually doing anything but yelling and pushing each other a bit. \n\nA couple other guys on the floor tried to break it up, but the guys \"fighting\" were way bigger then they were so they weren't able to. Another kid who also ad a midterm the next morning was trying to reason with them to keep quiet, but they would not listen. \n\nThis continued for about half an hour, these guys shouting at each other but not actually coming to blows, and more and more people came to watch. A lot of us were pretty annoyed, just wanting to go to bed again. The RAs (Residence Admins) for the building were nowhere to be seen. \n\nMy two roommates had gone downstairs to a friend's room to sleep on her floor, but I didn't go with them. I'm way too light a sleeper to fall asleep on a floor. \n\nI was getting really sick of being kept up by their bullshit posturing (Over half an hour of it by then) and, realizing nobody was going to be able to stop it in time for me to get some sleep before my bio exam, I called out \"I've got a test tomorrow morning. If you don't get the hell out of here, I'm calling the cops.\" \n\nNeither of the guys even looked at me, but a lot of the onlookers looked over in surprise. I stood there for about 10 seconds waiting to see if the guys who were fighting would acknowledge me, and when they didn't, I turned around and walked away to my room. A couple girls who were friends of the guys followed me, they were really drunk and were trying to tell me not to. One of them fell down halfway down the hall and her friend stopped to help so they didn't come to my room. \n\nI went into my room, locked up, and called the cops anonymously. (Remember, my roommates were gone for the night so I was alone.) I basically said there were two drunk 18 year olds (Drinking age is 21 here) about to beat each other up on the 10th floor of (my dorm room). I got ready for bed again. Within 10 minutes the fighting had stopped, and I fell asleep. \n\nThis morning, I got up to take my test, my roommates still gone, and did great on it! I didn't go back to my dorm until late this afternoon, having classes and a club meeting. I got back and my roommates immediately asked me if I'd really called the cops. \n\nI said yeah, and they were pissed. They said that in the time I had been asleep, and out to class, the 2 guys in the fight had been kicked out of on-campus housing permanently. Also half the floor, a lot of their friends included, had been written up for underage drinking. One of my roommates, Jess, had a boyfriend who had gotten his second (out of 3) underage drinking strikes that night from my school. (You only get 3 for all 4 years of college) \n\nThe rest of the floor is pretty pissed at me too; last night, immediately after I announced I was going to call the cops, a bunch of people went looking for my room to convince me not to, but with my roommates gone, nobody knew my room number. While I had heard people in the halls, I hadn't realized that was what they were doing. My being gone all today just escalated stuff too, I think. \n\nWhile my close friends live in other dorms and haven't been affected by this whole shitstorm, my roommates are mad at me, and a lot of the people on my floor and all their friends are furious at me. They're the ones I've got to live with for the rest of the semester, and I don't know how to handle it.\n\nI didn't mean to get all them written up for drinking. I don't care that the two guys fighting got in trouble (Having grown up with family with anger management issues, violence and disrespect is something I have no patience for) but it all escalated way more than I expected. \n\nI haven't gone back to my dorm since speaking with my roommates; I'm spending the night at a friend's apartment since I don't want to have to deal with all the drama going on back at my own dorm. But after tonight, I don't know what I should do?\n\nTLDR - I called the cops on two guys shouting and threatening to fight each other at 3 am in my dorm, since they were keeping me up before a midterm.

I really need a place to vent & ask for advice. So my younger brother is going to college this August 2015, my mother is asking & expecting me to pay for his college tuition & living costs even though I'm still paying for my student loans.\n\nMy older sister, 26, is in her last year of pharmacy school and will graduate this May. Her pharm school tuition + living cost are about 60k/year and my parents are helping her 40k/year because they don't want her to be in too much debt when she graduate. She went to a private university far away from home for her undergrad and the cost was 30k/year, which my parents were paying for it entirely. I went to a public university close to home (20 mins) for my undergrad where I got very good scholarships that I have extra money left + I have a part time job.

My sister & I are very different in personality wise and look wise. During my teen years, I suffered from cystic acne for 7 years & I have scoliosis so when I walk, I limp a little. My mother and my sister would constantly verbally abused me during my teen years about my acne and scoliosis. Therefore, I wasn't confident with myself and I usually look down when talking with someone, after a while it becomes a habit. One time her friend came to visit and asked why I always looked down & why I limp when I walked, my mother said it's because I have many acne and I choose to walk that way. It is partially true that I like to look down, but I didn't choose to walk like that, because of my scoliosis one of my leg is shorter than the other and when I try to walk straight, it hurts. I explained that and she ignored me. After that I rarely come out of my room or attend any event with my family. The past 2-3 years, I have been acne-free and it was a boost to my confidence. Last Christmas, I went to the family gathering at my uncle\u2019s house and a lot of my relatives couldn\u2019t recognize me but they were giving me compliments until my mom went ballistic. She started yelling at me that it\u2019s because I\u2019m selfish and I don\u2019t care about anyone and that is why I didn\u2019t attend any family gathering hence why they can\u2019t recognize me. I was extremely humiliated, cried and left. My mother has always have a strong bond with my sister, they do many mother-daughter activities that I\u2019m left out of. When I started graduate school and my tuition was 40k/year, I asked my parents for help financially with living costs because I know they can\u2019t afford sister\u2019s & my tuition at the same time. My mother got angry and started saying that I\u2019m selfish because I only care about myself, that I don\u2019t think for my sister\u2019s future and I enjoy making my parents feeling inadequate for being poor. So I took out student loans and never ask for any help again. But my mother didn\u2019t stop there, she told my sister the story and my sister went off at me, calling me a spoiled princess because I went through undergrad being debt free so I\u2019m more fortunate than most of the population out there therefore now it\u2019s time for me to live the \u201creal world\u201d. I graduated with 2 master\u2019s degree last year and was very fortunate to land a good job. I also moved out with my longtime boyfriend who paid off my student loan for me so I don\u2019t have to pay interest. Now I\u2019m paying my student loans to him by monthly payments and we\u2019re saving up for our wedding (in September next year) and a nice house. \n\nNow this is where the story is connected. Last Saturday, my mother approached me and told me that since my parents helped me out by letting me stay at home during my undergrad. Now to payback that favor, I have to pay for my brother\u2019s college education. She also said I should pay my sister\u2019s debt when she graduate so that she doesn\u2019t have to pay high interest. I asked her if my brother & sister will pay me back that money when they started working and she got mad at me for being calculating toward my own siblings. She started calling me names and told me that I\u2019m ungrateful, selfish and that she knows I\u2019ve always hate and being jealous of my sister because she is better looking, smarter and people likes her more. I told her that I\u2019m jealous of my sister because she has always been the favorite child not because she is better looking, smarter or people likes her more but I don\u2019t hate her. I also reminded my mother that when I worked part time in undergrad. I sent that money to my sister monthly so that she could have extra money to spend & that I don\u2019t have enough money to pay for my brother\u2019s college tuition & sister\u2019s debt. My mother told me that with my boyfriend & my income we should be able to do that. I told her that is not right because it\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s money and neither she nor I have the right to tell him what he should do with it. She said that she is not coming to my wedding & will kick me out of the family & all of my relatives will do the same. She called me on Wednesday to come pick up my pictures from the family album and when I got there she was cutting up my baby pictures and telling me my sister is always the favorite child because she is not selfish and she have always listens to my parents. I told her that she verbally abused me in the past because of my acne and the way I walked for years but I\u2019ve always listened and never talked back to her about it then she said it\u2019s because of my ugly personality that I deserve to have those things happened to me and she wished she had suffocate me when I was a baby. I've been crying for the past days and I don't know what to do when my own family won't even come to my wedding. Should I negotiate with my mother about paying half of my brother's tuition? \n\n**tl;dr**: Mother is expecting me to pay for brother\u2019s college education & sister\u2019s debts otherwise she will kick me out of the family & refusing to come to my wedding.\n"}, {"comments": [">My brothers/his uncles are against the idea and they think it's wrong to go against the will.\n\nYou can tell them to pound sand.

My position was that there is no harm in her trying, and that there is no substitute for legitimate interest, which she seemed to have. My wife took the pessimistic view. She thought our daughter needed a dose of reality, and she gave it to her. At first kindly, then not so kindly. That caused a lot of friction between them, and if I'm being honest they have never been that close. My daughter resisted, and actually got really motivated to prove her wrong. I helped her get through a calculus textbook over the summer, and she started last fall taking classes to become an electrical engineer.\n\nShe gave it the ole' college try (pun intended) but it didn't work out. She was disappointed, and decided to not go back for the spring semester. She didn't know what she wanted to do, but my wife was furious when she told us.

It was an illusion of control and of responsibility, including moral responsibility, which you're feeling right now.

"], "edited": false, "id": "3uj509", "body": "Hi Reddit. I'm posting here in the hope that someone can give me some advice, share their experiences, I don't know. I'm just completely at a loss. I feel like my heart has been ripped out.\n\nMy fiance (let's call him Jake) and I have been together for 7 years. I don't know a life without him. I met him at university, we stayed together past graduation, and moved into a flat which we bought together 2 years ago. He proposed last summer and we were set to wed in July 2017. We have had very few problems until now.\n\nMy sister (let's call her Sara) is an extremely volatile person. Growing up, I doted on her completely but she had a lot of personal issues that made our home life turbulent. Her childhood was very different to mine. My parents had very little money, they were on the brink of a divorce, my dad was physically violent on a number of occasions. Whilst things improved drastically in the years after I was born, she has an abundance of problems that stem back to this. My parents feel a lot of guilt about Sara's upbringing, and used to let her get away with some shocking behavior. \n\nSara had the same boyfriend for as long as I can remember (they dated from when they were 16), and their relationship was toxic. They habitually broke up and got back together; when they were good, they were crazy in love. But more often than not, she would have these insane arguments (sometimes physical) with him then take out her frustrations and despair on myself and my parents. I remember spending many nights lying by her side in bed while she cried so hard she would retch. After their arguments, she would throw plates and glasses at the wall, hit herself. Sometimes she would hit me and my parents too. It was like he was a drug to her, and she was emotionally stunted and didn't know how to see anything past their relationship. \n\n2 months ago, her boyfriend called things off for good. I don't know what gave, but after nearly two decades together, he finally had enough. He booked a one way ticket to another country, changed his number, deleted all social media profiles, and essentially disappeared from Sara's life. To this day, she still won't explain what caused this, but it was long overdue. \n\nTo say Sara was devastated is an understatement. She moved out of their shared rented apartment, and in with my parents. I would visit her most days after work, where she would flit in between explosive rage to an almost catatonic silence, staring at the wall with tears streaming down her face. At one point, we were all extremely worried she might seriously harm herself and organized for her to see a therapist (something I had suggested for years). Of course, she backed out days before her appointment, and there were no consequences. She is, after all, a grown woman. She just hasn't changed emotionally in the entire time I've known her, and still acts like a teenager.\n\n2 days ago. I went to visit Sara, who was in bed in her darkened room. I let myself in and attempted to speak to her, telling her about my day at work. She immediately exploded, screaming at me, throwing her pillows across the room, crying uncontrollably. She told me life was unfair. That I had everything and she was left alone to \"rot\". That everything wrong in her life was because she was a bad person. She hurt her boyfriend, she drove him away, she's ruined our family, **she fucked Jake and didn't even feel guilty at the time**. I initially thought I'd misheard her, but then she said it again. It was like she had poured a bucket of ice water over me.\n\nI silently left, shaking. When I got home, Jake was there watching TV. It came out of my mouth the second I saw him, and I could see in his eyes it was true. He broke down, and told me it had happened 3 years ago. Sara had had another blazing row with her boyfriend and decided to drive round to Jake's looking for me. I was at our parents at the time and Jake attempted to pacify Sara. He comforted her while she sobbed in his arms, and one thing led to another. They had sex.\n\nI packed an overnight bag while he followed me from room to room, sobbing and telling me it was the worst mistake of his life, that he still has no idea how it happened. That he felt unbelievably guilty the second it was over, that it feels like it wasn't even real. I left him in the doorway begging me not to leave.\n\nI've checked into a hotel and have switched my phone off. I don't know what to do, who to tell, where to begin. I feel sick, like this is a bad dream. My heart feels like it's been ripped into a million pieces. For all of Sara's faults, I love her more than anything. It's the two people who are more to me than anyone else in the world.\n\nHow the fuck do I move on from this? I feel like I'm in a bubble. I don't know what's going on in the outside world. All I do is cry and sleep in this room. Someone please help me make sense of this.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My volatile sister recently went through a break up after a 16 year relationship with the love of her life. She is severely depressed and almost catatonic; I went to visit her one day only for her to explode and tell me she slept with my fiance 3 years ago. He admitted it was true and I haven't spoken to a soul since. I have locked myself in a hotel room with no plans of ever coming out.

I opened the door and my boss was standing outside my bedroom, with some random cell phone in her hand.

If it is hard to get the kids in for a bit, at least call the school and ask if the school counselor can touch base with them.\n\nYou can do this.  You are making the right choices.", "Don't you fucking dare allow your kids to be around that man. ", "Oh man, that is tragic. I'm so glad you are there for your kids. It would probably be best to get the three of you into family therapy. This motherfucker lied about and distorted so many things that they still might believe awful stuff about you that you don't even know about yet. A therapist can help you all unpack that. \n\nDon't let them see him, ever - he *was* mean to them, he tried to alienate them from you, he scared them out of telling you what was going on, and worst of all he forced them to witness abuse. He abused your children. I know it must be unimaginably hard to feel like you're keeping them away from their mother, but in truth you are protecting them from their abuser. It's the only thing you can do: love them, protect them, use all the resources you can to find professional help for your family.\n\n", "You have done everything 100% right. This is really sad to read, but in all honesty, I work with families in similar situations and seeing someone *actually get it right* is fucking lovely. \n\nYes, this will hurt and confuse your kids for a while. But I promise you, in the long run this is so, so much better for their wellbeing and development. You have removed them from an extremely abusive home - and even if he didn't hit them (yet) witnessing their mom being harmed *is* causing emotional harm to them. Being in a home where that is going on is so damaging, and you have done the right thing. You are doing the right thing. \n\nAnd everything you've offered mom regarding contact is great. That's exactly what I would've advised - neutral spaces or your house and no boyfriend. Or, contact being supervised by a trustworthy adult (I.e you). \n\nHonestly, if she isn't even willing/able to try one of the more than reasonable contact options you've offered, that is a sign she still isn't able to prioritise the children over her shithead boyfriend and yeah, maybe for now she shouldn't be having contact at all. If this is how things are, I'd worry about any unsupervised contact in case Asshole decided to drop by. \n\nThe sad reality is, you can't do anything more to help her. It really sucks, and I feel so bad for her, but you can't make her leave him. If her not seeing her kids wasn't enough of a motivating factor to seek support and find a safe exit from that relationship, I don't know what would be. Give it time, she may still be working up the courage. \n\nAs for how to handle this with your kids, please remember that *you* did not create this situation. *You* aren't stopping them from seeing their mom -Asshole is. This will be very hard for them to understand and they have experienced a trauma as well; perhaps you could seek a child therapist or social worker to help them and you talk about it? The general rules are to give them space to talk about their feelings, validate them, be loving and reassuring but also be honest (in a way which fits their understanding). It's often surprising how much kids understand about the problems of adults in their lives. \n\nAnd - you don't say their ages, but if they're old enough to have phones or some degree of private computer access, please make sure mom and Asshole aren't continuing their manipulation through those means. \n\nTo summarise: this sucks, but you're doing great and doing everything right, keep being kind and open with your kids, seek a professional to help them understand what they experienced and what's happening now, and to advise you on how to talk to them about it. \n\nGood luck. You're a great parent. \n\nEdit: and make sure their school knows mom and/or Asshole are not, under any circumstances, allowed to collect them. "], "edited": true, "id": "56oob6", "body": "This situation is very fucked to put it likely. My ex and I grew up together, married young, and divorced about 5 years ago. We have two children, both under the age of 13. The divorce was mutual and we managed to maintain a very good relationship/friendship afterwards. We split custody 50/50 and would spend at least one weekend together with our children a month. \n\nAbout two years ago my ex met Asshole. Asshole is a terrible person and all around piece of shit. Unfortunately my ex was unable to see this for some reason and fell very hard for him. After about 6 months they moved in together. After they began living together, things started to decline very very rapidly. He began to prevent my ex from spending time with her friends/family. He encouraged her to quit her job and be a stay at home wife, and despite the fact that she was in a career she loved, she agreed. She stated spending 100% of her time with him (he works from home) and basically cut off everyone in her life. People expressed worry and as soon as they did, they were cut off b/c \"if they can't be happy that she is happy, they don't deserve her time\". \n\nImmediately after moving in together our monthly \"family weekends\" ended b/c he thought of them as disrespectful to their relationship. This despite the fact that he was welcome to join, just as my girlfriend has for the last 3 years. She stopped interacting with me at all \"out of respect for him\" and it got to the point where I could not talk to her unless it was through him. This all went on through the first year and a half. \n\nAbout 7 months ago or so he has started extending his behavior to my children. He attempted to force them to cut off people in their lives, even trying to home school them. He started bad talking me/my girlfriend to them and encouraging them to dislike us. My ex started doing the same. \n\nThen I found out he was beating her. I had my suspicions but before this point I had no proof. Then she was sent to the hospital with very severe injuries after \"falling down the stairs\". The stairs don't give you strangle marks on your neck. I had been asking my kids about this for months, but they never mentioned anything about violence and had always insisted that they liked their time at their mothers house. \n\nCome to find out it is because Asshole and my ex had basically convinced them that if they \"tattled\" about the abuse their mother would wind up in prison and they would never see her again. After this came out (while my ex was still in the hospital) i immediately took my children and got an emergency order for full custody. This was about 3 months ago. My children have not been allowed back at their mothers place since. I refuse to allow them to interact with Asshole at all. \n\nTheir mother is welcome to visit them in a neutral space, but asshole is not allowing it and she is going along with it. My kids miss their mother and they are starting to resent me for keeping them away from her. I have done everything i can think of to give her a chance to remain in their lives. I have offered to allow sleep-overs at their grandparents (her side) with their mother. \n\nI have offered to allow her to stay at my home with the kids for the weekend, and my girlfriend and I would sleep elsewhere so she would have the place to herself with them. But she is not budging. She refuses to accept any visitation where her boyfriend is not present. Out of desperation I have even offered to allow visits at her place with her boyfriend present as long as I am able to chaperone for the entire time. \n\nEven this was rejected since \"it is disrespectful to her boyfriend\". I am at my wits end here. My ex has always been a confident, strong minded woman. She has been extremely successful (partner at her law firm by the age of 35) and has never been one to take shit from people. I don't understand how she can allow this man to break her like this. \n\nI don't understand how she is putting him, before her own kids. And now my kids are starting to blame me for keeping her away from them. Today, my youngest asked me why i hate her mom and don't want her mom to love them. I honestly don't know what to do. Please, just tell me, was i wrong to take full custody? Should I let her see them on her terms? He has never hit my kids or even been mean to them (as far as I know). \n\nHe is actually overly nice to them, never yells at them or anything. But he actually will yell at my ex for discipling them. While i don't think they are at risk with him, i don't want them seeing that type of behavior and thinking it is ok.

Obviously not their real names. \n\nMy brother Sam became engaged 8 months ago to Kate after a year of dating. They have a 3 month old son. Sam and I have never been super close with each other\u2026..we are very different people and have very little in common. We were very different as kids\u2026.I was always reading and he was always playing video games. He dropped out of school at 15, right when I went off to University. He was in trouble with the law for a while there and we didn't have much to do with each other. We get along civilly, but he does allow Kate to make an endless stream of side remarks to me which is a sore point for me. Sam never once sticks up for me, even when my parents have been shocked at what she says. Kate also tries to 'push me out' a lot by saying things like how she is my parents daughter. Basically, she has always tried to take my place to compensate for having had a crappy childhood with a single mother who didn't care about her. It sucks for her, but that doesn't mean her behaviour isn't infuriating for me you know? \n\nSam and Kate have decided to have a huge wedding and bacherlor/ettes in Thailand and are now expecting me to pay my own way there and book a 11 day trip to Thailand and pay for all my own expenses, including flights. They are taking out a loan to make the wedding possible because Kate has \u2018always wanted\u2019 a \u2018dreamy beach destination wedding\u2019. (I think that is stupid. I mean it is their life and their finances but why hasn\u2019t that clued them in on how it might also be unaffordable for their guests? If I didn't have savings, would they expect me to take a loan). \n\nThey also want me to be a bridesmaid and given that Kate asked her 2 best friends 4 months ago (I saw it on instagram, she did the \u2018will you be my bridesmaid\u2019 proposal thing)\u2026.I asked why they were asking now and they admitted one of Kate\u2019s friends backed out because of the coats and they \u2018need another and there isn\u2019t really anyone else\u2019. They're angry at Kate's friend for backing out, but she agreed to be a bridesmaid *before* she knew they were planning on taking the wedding from Australia to Thailand. I\u2019m not exactly thrilled about the idea of being a \u2018back up bridesmaid\u2019, especially to someone I know dislikes me at worst, is indifferent to me at best. Eff that, tbh. This is going to cost *thousands* of dollars. My parents are not thrilled about the wedding, but are going along with it because they know any disagreement and my brother will take it out on them because whatever Kate wants, Sam makes sure she gets. My parents love their grandson and they know if they 'annoy' Kate too much, they can forget about seeing him. I think Kate knows that and uses her baby to get her way. \n\nThis wedding is not how I want to spend my own money and it is now causing a big drama. \n\nEven before this became an issue, I was always of the opinion that expensive destination weddings are incredibly selfish and entitled because the couple is expecting their guests to pay a *lot* of money to attend and essentially dictating to them where their next holiday will be without considering they might want to go somewhere else.

I don\u2019t want to spend all my savings on a beach holiday I\u2019ll hate. \n\nI can technically afford to go based on the balance of my savings account, but I\u2019m saving for something important.

That is my plan for the money I\u2019ve been saving from my part time tutoring job. The wedding is being held during the internship. They want me to give it up even though it could be the big break of my career. This is how I want to use the money. There is now an expectation I\u2019ll back out of this and go to the wedding and even pay to be Kate\u2019s bridesmaid. \n\nI\u2019ve said no. Sam is losing his shit because Kate is pissed off I\u2019m not bowing to her wishes. My parents are urging me to reconsider. I know they think this is all bullshit (my father in particular thinks Kate is ridiculous), but they know the kind of hold Kate has over my brother and know if they even slightly upset her, he'll side with her and they might not see their grandkid. They enable her because she\u2019s insane and entitled. \n\nAm I being the unreasonable one?\n\nOne of the things that makes Sam/Kate and I so different is that we have different goals and interests. I have an undergraduate Law/French degree (possible in my country) and am now studying a masters degree. Kate has said on Facebook that her goal is to get a husband so she \u2018doesn\u2019t have to work\u2019 and can \u2018have babies\u2019. Sam dropped out of school and works a blue collar job. I\u2019m not looking down on that, but it means he doesn\u2019t really understand how important opportunities like the one I have been offered are for careers like the one I am pursuing. We are very different people with very different goals in life, which is fine, but it means they don\u2019t understand that giving up and opportunity like this could be giving up my \u2018big break\u2019 and to me, my career for the next 50 years is more important than someone\u2019s wedding day. They *knew* I would be interning in Paris when they selected this date because I told them long before they picked a date. It makes me wonder if Kate knew what she was doing in picking this date. \n\nWhat do you think reddit? Am I the bad guy for saying I\u2019m not spending all my money to indulge Kate\u2019s \u2018fairytale wedding dream\u2019 and sticking to my study abroad/internship plans or do I have to suck it up?\n\n**tldr: brother is expecting me to spend the $10k+ I\u2019ve saved to study/intern abroad on a destination beach wedding when I hate the beach and the bride is constantly rude to me.

Before we had sex, I told him about the HIV. I insisted that we use condoms and that if he wasn't okay with the risk, that we had to break it off. We got married anyway and decided to start a family. To conceive we did IVF. We have never had sex without a condom, ever. Not even once. \n\nMy husband gets an HIV test every six months to make sure he was healthy. After my daughter was born, he tested negative. His most recent test, he came up positive. He refused to tell me the result for over a week, and instead withdrew and became angry at me. He isn't talking to me about it, and all he does is go to work and then retreat to his man cave. I'm positive that he isn't on any medication because I haven't seen any around the house. When I try to talk to him, he gives me nasty looks and gets really snappy. \n\nReddit, what do I do? He knew this was a risk when he married me. He knew that we were risking a child born with HIV when we went in for fertility treatments. Plus, HIV is not the end of the world. I've been positive for over 10 years and I take a few pills a day, but it's not like it's that big of a deal. I know that sounds really weird, but he's lived with me for years and has even commented on it. Besides the condoms and the meds, my life is 100% normal and he has seen how little of a deal this disease can be (it can be pretty awful as well, but when controlled it's almost a non-issue). \n\nWhat on earth do I say to him? \n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Husband knew I was HIV positive when he married me. We have a child together. He tested positive for HIV and now he won't talk to me. \n\n**Update:: I texted him to see if he was okay and to let him know I loved him and would support him. After a short chat, I asked him if he needed to tell me anything. He had an affair with a coworker.

Your daughter took a chance on you being accepting, and you were!   Now comes the next phase.\n\nThe other comments I see advising you to tell her you support her are 100% right.  I'd send her a letter or an email letting her know this and then let her come to you when she's ready.  She might need a few days, or a few weeks, or even a few months.  But always let her know you love and support both her AND her partner.\n\nIf you want to talk to parents who are going through the same thing, check out PFLAG (http://community.pflag.org/).  I am not sure if they have meetings in your area, but you might find support from someone who can relate to what your feeling in terms of almost missing out on your daughter's life.  I'm sure your daughter would appreciate the effort.\n\nAnd one last thing:  do not out her to anyone.  She will come out to who she feels comfortable with.  That is her choice, and sometimes family members can turn ugly or even abusive when they know.  \n\nAnd from my perspective, I can say that I wish I had a parent like you.  One that looks on me proudly and would have no trouble accepting who I ended up loving.  One that accepted me and was glad to know about my life, even the weird \"gay\" stuff.  One that would defend me to the bigots in our family, and not look at me with misery and sadness every time we met in person.

At the time I had been surprised but have come to terms with the relationship. \n\nMy relationship with Jane since this point has gone from infrequent calls to daily texts and I have never felt so included in her life. Jane introduced me to her girlfriend over skype and I have never seen her so happy. \n\nMy problem is that, looking back, I now see how reserved Jane had always been. She's 1 of 4 children, and was always the quiet one, willing to listen but never gave her opinion on anything. To be frank, I spent much of her childhood frustrated, thinking I was raising a pushover with no personality at all. Now that she's including me to her personal facebook, I feel I have discovered a whole new person. She's now vibrant, empathetic and is going out of her way to visit more often, willing to discuss openly anything from news, movies, memories all the way to hobbies and interests she had never shared with me before.\n\nThanksgiving (US) is a big time for families. I guess I grew too accustomed to Jane's new behaviour, but I was stunned and confused to find that she had entirely reverted to her old self over the holiday. She never spoke unless spoken too, would gloss over questions asked of her, barely participating in anything unless coerced by her brothers into even coming out of her room. \n\nMy worry for Jane caused me to notice more about my and my wife's extended families that I hadn't considered before. While Jane refrained from participating in conversation for the most part, I saw the most emotion in her for the entire weekend when on the first night her Uncle (My brother[64 M]) mentioned her brother [27 M] would look like a 'faggot' if he wore a particular scarf. Growing up in a military family, with my brother also in the military I had thought nothing of the comment until I heard my wife comment Jane jumped backward, almost bowling her over. \n\nOver the short time Jane was visiting (she only stayed for 2 nights instead of the whole weekend) there were a few other times I noticed both my family (Mostly my brother mentioned above, my father and my wife's parents) mentioning comments about gay marriage that seemed to cause Jane to shut down even further.\n\nNone of it was positive, and I'm starting to question how Jane might have felt even around me in the past. I was never particularly against homosexuality but after seeing my daughter's reactions I'm worried she has spent her whole life afraid of her own family. Perhaps even I had let slip comments in the past that drove her further away. \n\nJane hasn't spoken with me since Thanksgiving (almost a week), and her girlfriend (Naomi) only sent me an email advising I give Jane some time. \n\nI don't know how the rest of the family might react, but I'm terrified of Jane feeling she might have to cut us all off. I love my daughter unconditionally, but I am abiding by her wish for now. No one else in my family seems to think anything is amiss, and none of them know about Jane's sexuality as far as I know (my wife included), Jane being as reserved as she'd always been, and I am finding myself more and more enraged that my own child might have been facing (hopefully unintentional?) verbal abuse her whole life that I was not aware of from the same people I had always told her would be the ones to always stand behind her. The only ones who would never betray her.\n\nHow can I help my daughter? I don't want to force my way in, but the last few months of my life were the best years I have ever had with her, and I'm worried they might be the only ones I might ever have.

There's no guarantee I can change our family, and while I think they only joke in jest, I am torn between wanting to sit everyone down and talk this out, but this would also likely end up outing Jane unwillingly to her extended family and I don't want to give her further reason to leave forever. How can I help when I don't know what Jane wants or how to bring up concerns to our family before Christmas that might arouse suspicion?\n\n**Edit**: I'm putting together an email to Naomi now. I'm trying to ensure they know I'm not encroaching on their personal space but I think I'm finally managing to lay out my feelings in the rest of the message. I probably won't send it tonight, so I have time to mull it over, but I want my daughter to know that I love every part of her with all my heart.

She starts out sort of cryptically, baiting me to ask questions to further the conversation. Whether or not she realizes it, she\u2019s attempting to manipulate me at this point, but I could see what was happening. She is coming across as a victim of mental and emotional abuse from her family, suffers from depression and anxiety, yadda yadda, and she is fishing for support.

Telling me that she makes her family sleep in the basement during thunderstorms. \n\n\nWhen I came home she sent me several texts. About the workshop, some movie star she talked to once, her handyman\u2019s phone number that I actually asked for. They all said things like I really loved having you here, and these are all exact quotes in the 3 different texts- I adore you,  all my love, hugs.

I need some help knowing what to do :(\n\nI have been on a few academic teams in college for 4 years now. This is the second year I have qualified for nationals. Last year I had a different partner (who is female), but she graduated. Jake (my current partner) has been in the team for two years and his partner from last year (they never qualified for nationals) also graduated. Jake and I are the two best scoring people on our team this year so we are partners now. And we qualified for nationals this year.\n\nI guess I would describe Jake as a friend, but we aren\u2019t close. The only times we have hung out outside of practice is when he came to my 21st birthday (everyone on my teams were invited), when we have gotten coffee specifically to review our content for the team, or getting drinks after practice (which everyone over 21 comes to, so it\u2019s not us). We don\u2019t really text or talk outside of team-related stuff though.\n\nMy boyfriend has been supportive of everything I do up until now. I\u2019ve been with him for a year and he has come to see me compete and has met Jake and my other teammates. He has even met up with all of us for after-practice happy hour before.\n\nWhen my boyfriend learned I got invited to nationals he wasn\u2019t as excited as I thought he would be. He asked me if any other partnership from our team qualified (normally we have at least 3 pairs going) and I said unfortunately, no. It would be just me, Jake, and our two coaches (both 50s M- paid by the school). He freaked out and we got in a huge argument. He said it wasn\u2019t appropriate of me to take a trip across the country with a bunch of men when I\u2019m in a relationship and that I should tell me coach I can\u2019t go and he can fill my spot with someone else (my coach would be PISSED). He said last year when I went and the other times when I have traveled with my team are different because there was a huge group of people and more women going.\n\nI tried to explain that I will have my own hotel room, I won\u2019t be rooming with any of them, but he didn\u2019t care. He also said this shouldn\u2019t be that important to me since I went last year. I tried explaining that Jake is better than my partner last year so we actually have a good chance of ranking high. He wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\nThe part that made me storm out was when he implied that my coaches were predators and that it\u2019s \u201cweird that they wanna travel alone with me like that\u201d (DUH, no one else qualified to go!) and he said he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s safe.\n\nThis is pretty gross to me considering i have known my coaches and been traveling with them since my freshman year of college. They are both father figures and mentors to me (they have kids my age for God\u2019s sake).

I was very academically inclined but shy whereas my little brother was an athletic social butterfly who got B's and C's.  My parents owned their own business and worked 364 days a year and only had Christmas Day off--so they were incredibly hands off when it came to helping us with school.\n\nI had instances where my dad would tell me to 'help' my brother by writing his essays for him, or he would take my old work and give it to him. Obviously, my brother would use it.\n\nI felt hurt too, like you did, but conflicted because here he was, riding off of my 'success,' if you can even call it that. But I also worried that my brother's marks would be too low without my help, and would just get lower. On top of that, my parents weren't rich and worked so hard--I felt guilty by saying no.\n\nSo I continued this way for a few years, thinking that I was just helping him to buy time and he would then be smart and catch up on his own. I couldn't stop either because I was worried that if I didn't help, he would be streamed out of high school classes that would gear him towards university. In that case, he wouldn't be able to choose if he wanted to go because that choice would be already made for him.\n\nYou know what happened? Obviously, he didn't work harder to help himself.\n\nI still remember reaching one of my breaking points one night. I had taken a computer science course in grade 10 where the final project was to create a little restaurant ordering program that would calculate the order total and ask if you wanted extras, that kind of thing. I remember the teacher had a list of bonus tasks you could do for extra credit, like including computer graphics in certain places and whatnot. I did all of them and had one of the most complicated programs to hand in. We were given a lot of time in class towards the end of the semester to finish this.  Of course, two years later, my brother also took the same class and had the same assignment.\n\nOne evening, my brother asked me for help. I asked him when it was due and he said it was due the next day. I was steaming mad, because he had spent the whole evening playing video games and was only asking me for help at midnight. He hadn't even started! On top of that, I KNEW he had been given many chances to work on it in class, so it's not like the teacher didn't give him enough time to work on it.\n\nIt was at that moment that I realized that I HAD to say no to him. He had played video games all evening, not because the assignment was too hard, but because he knew that big sis would bail him out with a flawless assignment that he could just tweak to make his own. All that time I had helped him because I was worried he would do poorly otherwise only taught him to become lazy and expect others to bail him out--the very same thing that I thought I was helping him avoid!\n\nYes, by saying no I was making things more difficult at first, but what I learned is that **you must help him learn to fail when he is young because the stakes are lower and he can learn from his mistakes without jeopardizing his future. The longer you 'help' him, the higher the stakes get and the more you will feel forced to help him, otherwise he will fail completely and not get in to post secondary school, or graduate from university, etc.**\n\nMy dad also tried to guilt trip me to do it for my brother. When I said no, my dad said \"if you won't do it for him, then do it for *me.*\". That was tough but you HAVE to stick to your guns because you are only crippling your brother if you continue.\n\nYour brother is only 14 now, so I would tell your parents why they absolutely cannot enable his behaviour any longer. Soon, he will be looking at post secondary institutions, and it's not cheap to fail out then--which is exactly the path they have put him on.\n\nIf your parents still refuse after you speak to them and insist you continue, then I suggest that you not bring home any assignments and/or keep it from your parents. Cut them off at the source.\n\nThere is a good chance they will guilt you by saying that they are 'family' and that \"this is what families do\" and \"don't you love your brother and want him to succeed?\" You might get a \"we just need you to help a little longer.\" Take it from me--if they won't stop, then you need to practice some tough love and be strong. I know it's not something a smart 16 year old should have to put up with.\n\nI suggest you don't tell your parents that you feel hurt that you aren't getting recognition while your brother does nothing and gets awards. This argument will fall on deaf ears as they may likely suggest that you are just being selfish. I highly suggest you talk to your parents and focus on the negative consequences this will have on your brother. Even better if you can come up with concrete examples how little bro has just gotten further behind, or lazier, etc.\n\nGood luck!

I confronted my brother and he told me that my parents said it was okay. So i talked to them and they told me that my brother has been having a really tough time in school. He doesn't learn as fast as the others, and sometimes he just needs a little help. They have edited the papers a but so that it they aren't identical, but all of the research is mine. \n\nI get where they are coming from, and I understand that he needs to get good grades to get scholarships for college (we don't have the money to pay for it..), but this isn't fair on several levels. \n\nI work really hard at school so that I can get scholarships.

I lost my best friend to cancer...I'm soft for it. He goes. Returns at 4am via uber with a story about the party devolving due to bad elements showing up. (It was an hour away)\n\n\nI take my son to the Dr cause he's too tired. I notice a funny charge on my card. An uber ride for $36 or so after the one he took. The records show it was from near our house to an hour away. He swears he had no idea what happened. \n\n\nHe's spending a lot of time on the phone, texting, Facebook. He's become his friends with this terminally ill girl. I'm worried what that well do to him when we move, if she gets worse. She's always getting herself into trouble. Stories of not eating, needing to be saved. I keep refusing. \n\n\nShe needs a place to stay. I cave in, though I refuse to let her two friends stay. I tell my husband she has to come after my son's therapy session.  She comes hours beforehand. Thus begins two days of things I want to forget.\n\n\nI was nice to her. I didn't know. But when I woke up after the second night and there was a bed laid out on the living room floor and my husband was in my son's bed with her? I woke him up. He claims she wanted comfort after a scary movie. I didn't believe him. I told him she needed to leave. \n\n\nHe finally got her an expensive uber ride. She was supposed to go see her dr, but skipped out to a friend's house. \n\n\nMind you, during the time she was here I was working and took my son to an important doctor appointment that my husband swore he would go to. I repeatedly told my husband I was uncomfortable and asked if they had an inappropriate relationship. \n\n\nThat night I got him to admit they kissed. Ok...sure. He admitted she did something to him. Finally, I asked to see his phone if there was nothing to worry about. Well, text messages were relatively clean. Not so with Facebook. That's how I found out he didn't know her before their first meeting when he brought her back to our apartment while I was asleep with my son & brought her back in after he went to school.  The things they said are burned in my brain. \n\n\nThey were doing things in my apartment while my son watched cartoons and I was at work; or while we slept. I can't believe the nerve, the betrayal. He thought he could get away with it. He told her he loved her - after a few short weeks (which tells me something wrong there). \n\n\nI trashed everything I associate with her or them...blankets, his clothes, stuff she left... I have to live here. At least til the end if the month. When I think about it, I want to throw up and my chest hurts. I can't tell anyone. He took advantage of my son's disabilities and my blind spots.  (And he knew it based on reading the messages)\n\n\nHe is very insistent that the reason he did this is because he was seeking affection. First night it was revealed he was yelling right back at me over it. But I refuse to let him use that against me. Our issues before didn't warrant this treatment.\n\n\nMy instincts all told me, but I didn't listen. Now I'm paying the price. We move out of state in a couple weeks. Lease is signed. I can't afford it without him. I don't know what would happen with my son without him.\n\n\nSo my question is: can I move forward with him? Should I? I am his caretaker, though that may have led to some of our issues in the first place. \n\n\nHow do you protect yourself after such a violation? How can I tell he's sorry for what he did, not sorry he got caught? \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Husband slept with other woman in our home while I was sleeping, at work and while son was there - as secret & as house guest. How do I move forward? How can I tell if he's remorseful?

This will sound very odd to most people, but we had never made any effort to hide the fact that we were seeing another person. It was like one day, we both realized what was happening and we both started laughing about it. Marge knows that I am seeing several different men and women and I know that she has her boyfriends. We're both comfortable with this and we encourage each other to have fun and be happy.\n\nDespite our best efforts to keep this a secret, our children found out. My wife accidentally left her email account logged in on Maggie's iPad and Maggie went through her emails and printed out all of the private conversations between Marge and her boyfriends to give to me. Maggie and I had a long talk about the situation and I explained to her that not only was I aware of her mother's actions, but that I supported her mother 100% and that it was a mutual agreement between us. After my wife confirmed that it was true, Maggie said that she understood and would support us doing whatever made us happy. Our son Bart had a similar reaction and is fine with the situation as long as we are both happy.\n\nUnfortunately, Lisa has not been nearly as open minded as Maggie and Bart have been. Lisa has been calling my wife and crying on the phone to her, begging for her to leave me. Lisa does not believe that an open relationship can exist and she believes that I am manipulating Marge into staying with me. It has gotten to the point where my wife is tired of explaining the situation and has begun hanging up the phone whenever Lisa brings the subject up. Lisa has tried to get her siblings on her side, but neither Bart nor Maggie want anything to do with her after some of the posts she made online about us. Maggie and Lisa also got into a screaming match about the situation and Lisa banned Maggie from her house until further notice.\n\nThe holidays are coming up soon and I don't know if there's a way to fix this and make our family whole again.

I can't say that there will be an update, but should I find out anything of worth I'll be sure to post that in the future. **\n\nThrowaway for obvious reasons. I don't want this associated with my main account at all. \n\nFair warning: this is a VERY long story. You need to know everything there is to know to better understand how shitty this situation is for me. \n\nSeveral years ago, when I was 21, I met this \"fantastic\" British boy on an online game. He was in the process of finalizing his divorce to his then wife. I was super respectful when I found out the details of his relationship, even though it was coming to an end. It wasn't until after they were officially divorced and they had moved on that we began talking a bit more seriously about there being an \"us\". \n\nAfter several months of video chatting, texting, e-mails at work, etc, we decided to meet up. I drove to Florida to meet him, and everything felt like a fairy tale from then on. I honestly believed he was everything to me. We moved in together after we started dating, and after a few months of living together he expressed wanting to go \"home\", which meant the UK. We worked things out financially, and we zipped off to England where we lived with his parents for a year. During that time, he proposed. I was over the moon. I said yes, and then we had to have a come to Jesus talk about our situation. In the end, we moved back to The U.S. to complete his permanent residency, while living with my parents since he couldn't work at the time. \n\nHowever, during all of this I was very blind to what was actually happening. In the beginning, his ex-wife had contacted me about how he cheated on her, etc. Being the typical girl in a new relationship high I figured she was just bitter and angry, and he perpetuated that lie with stories about how she was crazy. You know, the usual. During the course of our relationship there were a few red flags that he was quick to have stories for. \"Oh this girl I'm chatting with? Old friend! We're just catching up!\" Of course, this was a lie, among -many- others that I found out about after the fact. \n\nThe biggest lie he told me was near the end of our relationship. I had a best friend named Cynthia, who he had gotten close to. Just a few days before my birthday he told me they were heading out to the mall to buy me a gift. You know, just a few hours, and then he'd be back. He didn't come home until 5 AM, when I was waking up to get ready for work. He claimed the car broke down on their way home from the mall, and that they had to call our mutual friend Kim to jump start the engine. Well, the mall closed at 10 PM, and when I spoke to Kim about it she said she met up with them just past 11 PM to help out, and that they were very drunk and touchy-feely, and they she felt awkward the entire time and asked why I wasn't there. She said they both claimed that they had asked me to hang out, but I said no. \n\nLo and behold, on my birthday, neither of them had a gift for me. At that point, it was pretty obvious that something had happened, and with previous evidence I was finally done with his bullshit. I gave him back the ring and informed my parents that our relationship was over. Keep in mind, I confided in my mother a lot. Growing up, we were very close, and I always went to her when I had an issue or was frustrated. She knew about everything, and I mean everything. \n\nI told my mother that I was contacting his parents, and I was arranging to buy his plane ticket back home to the UK. With my own money. As I saw it, he had cheated on me, and it was time to have him move out so we both could move on with our lives. At this time, I was 22 nearing 23. \n\nWRONG. My mother, and my father, decided to put their feet down and told me that I brought him back to America, so we needed to sort shit out. They also refused to let him move into the guest bedroom. For the next 6 months, I lived in Hell. He was verbally and emotionally abusive, didn't respect ANY of my boundaries. I worked 6 AM - 4 PM, and he was constantly up until 4-5 AM on Skype with new girls and gaming buddies being loud as hell, etc. The list goes on and on. It was awful, just take my word for it. On top of it all, I was constantly arguing with my parents about it. They saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with what was happening, and that we needed to be adults and work it out. \n\nNothing changed until I finally had a nervous breakdown and told them that if he didn't go, I would move out and take my $500 in rent and utilities elsewhere. They promptly agreed to let him move into the guest bedroom. \n\nHowever, he refused to move into the other bedroom! For the next week and a half I had to argue with him about moving his things. I finally got sick of it and moved his shit myself when he was out on a date with Cynthia. (We weren't friends anymore at this point, obviously). \n\nOnce he moved into the guest bedroom, things were okay. I was able to lock myself away in my room when I wasn't at work, and I really just poured myself into my job and doing art on the side for additional income. It was a shitty situation to be in, but I was trying to make it work. Unfortunately, it only got worse. It became clear that my parents were choosing his side over mine. He said a lot of nasty things about me to them, and I got to hear about them through them in a \"I can't believe you did this!\" way. My mother started leaving me nasty written letters under my door, and whenever I would confront her she would say everything she'd written was true- because my ex-fiance had told her. I reminded her that all of this \"information\" she was getting was coming from the mouth of a lying cheater, and she was going to take his word over mine, her own daughter? Well, she did. \n\nWhen I had managed to save up enough money I peaced out and moved out without a damn word to anyone. I had a friend several states away who was kind enough to let me rent out their spare bedroom, and that's what I rocked for a solid year before I met my current boyfriend and moved in with him. I'm in a happy, solid place in my life, and I'm almost 27. \n\nMy ex-fiance still lives with my parents. In the time after we broke up until I moved out he didn't have a job, and thus didn't pay rent or anything else. However, he did complete his permanent residency and is allowed to work. After I moved out, I didn't speak to my parents unless it was absolutely required. I called on Christmas, New Year's, Mother's day, etc. I didn't give my parents an address, either. I was fine with cutting all ties with my family since it was clear they were going to support my jackass of a lazy ex-fiance. \n\nSo, that was just over 3 years ago. Yes, he still lives with them. Over time, my relationship with my mother got a bit better, but she's never apologized for what happened. That's okay. I don't expect one from her, but I won't make her a priority in my life. \n\nThe other day, I got a random Facebook message from my ex-fiance's mother asking me to message him because he had a question for me. I was hesitant at first, but unblocked him on Facebook. I asked what was up, and he asked me about my TV and papasan chair. When we were living with my parents I bought both of these things, and when I moved out I left them behind because I didn't have room in my car, and I refused to make a second trip out of fear of dealing with him or my family. He said since he had been using them since I left, he just wanted to ask if he could take them, since he was moving out of my parent's house and into his own place. I said I didn't care. Honestly, I wasn't going to be getting those things back, and I really did not give two shits if he took them without my permission. That was the extent of our conversation. \n\nA few hours later, I get an angry phone call from my mother as to \"why in the hell would I give him permission to take the TV and chair\". I said, to be honest, I didn't give a damn. I hadn't seen either of those things in over three years, and I wasn't that god damned attached to them. If he was going to use them, so what? It's not like I was getting any use out of them. So then she went on a tirade about how he hasn't been paying rent since May, that he's knocked up Cynthia but left her for another girl (surprising), his room is an episode of hoarders gone wrong, etc. Also, while my mother was in the nursing home (she has failing health) and my dad was visiting he threw a huge party my uncle came home to. My uncle comes over to make sure the house is okay while my mother is in the hospital or the nursing home when she has really bad episodes. I spoke to him and he said it was close to 40-50 people who trashed the house, etc. The list goes on and on. \n\nMy mother then told me I had to deal with my ex-fiance, since it was originally my idea to bring him around. Apparently, she and my father had been trying to get him out for months but he either wasn't listening or said he would move out by a certain date then never would. I told her to call the police and have him forcibly removed since it's their house and if they're kicking him out they can escort him out and watch as he takes his things. She said no, that wouldn't do, and that I needed to handle this situation. \n\nThis is when I absolutely lost it. I reminded her of all of the bullshit I had to go through with him and her, and how, in the end, both she and my father supported him and his words over me. They paid for everything he needed such as close and cigarettes (and those aren't cheap!), catered to every need, yet if I was a day late on my rent (because I was waiting for payday) all hell would break loose. I reminded her that he had cheated on me, and when I made it clear our relationship was over they refused to let him move out of the house, much less my room until I finally snapped and threatened to move out. I reminded her every letter she slipped under my door, of every nasty insult she flung my way because he had lied to her, etc. I said no, she made her decision when she chose him over me, and she needed to stick to her guns and get him out of the house if that's what she truly wanted now.\n\nIt sucked getting that rude with my mother, but she had to know where I stood and the position she was trying to place me in. However, it's not as easy as that. My mother is very sick. She is constantly in and out of the hospital with heart/lung issues. She lives on an oxygen tank now, and any amount of stress can trigger a whole slew of issues. Her doctor's have warned her multiple times that stress can give her a stroke, etc. I've already lost my grandmother to a stroke, so I don't want my mother to go the same way. A part of me feels responsible for the situation, since I don't want my mother to have to put up with him. \n\nAfter my conversation with my mother, I sent my ex-fiance another message. I told him that after speaking to my mother I wasn't comfortable with him taking anything, including the TV or chair. I said those things were to remain where they are, and he is not allowed to take them. I said this was my first and last message to him regarding the issue, and to resolve this as peacefully as possible with my parents. They deserve that much. To be safe, I screenshotted the message and sent it to my mother, as well. I then blocked him on Facebook again. \n\nSo, my question is, did I handle this the right way? I feel incredibly bad that I don't want to do anything more for my parents, but at the same time I also feel that they made their bed and have to lie in it now. If anyone else has gone through something similar, what would you do? Should I call the police for them? Should I make a visit? I'm at a loss since I feel like I've done enough, but not \"enough\", if that makes any sense whatsoever. :/ Any help or advice is much appreciated. Thank you so much. \n\nTL;DR: Met a guy when I younger, got engaged and moved in with my parents. After he clearly cheated on me they picked his side over mine, my life was hell. I moved away and he still lives with them over 3 years later, and now my mom's expecting me to deal with him since they're trying to kick him out. \n\nEDIT: Fixed a few spelling mistakes.

Then you confirm with them that your memory is accurate, and let them know how it made you feel and why. Finally, give them the floor to respond, or ask them to stop the behavior. The basic structure is \u201cYou said  X, correct? Well, when you said X, it really made me feel Y because of my Z experience.

When I was in college, there were weeks when I ran out of food and money on Wednesday and didn\u2019t get paid til Friday so I just didn\u2019t eat those days.

So my ombudsman recommended the following script for the next time she bitches: \u201cIf I understand correctly, you felt embarrassed when your in-laws paid for dinner with a gift card, because you\u2019d prefer they pay entirely with cash or a credit card? To be honest, I have a hard time not feeling offended by comments like that because I\u2019ve gone hungry before and would\u2019ve been thankful for any food, no matter how it was paid for. I\u2019ve used visa gift cards without any shame in the past, and now I feel like you\u2019re judging and shaming me as well. Why do you feel that way? I want to know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n\nShe actually recommended calling out my coworker in front of others in this way, as showing vulnerability has a lot of power and other coworkers might share my feelings and have had similar experiences, so they might feel empowered to speak up in the future if they see someone else do it.

My grandmother has a lot of issues, one of them being that she is bipolar.  She is widowed (grandfather passed away in 2007) so she lives by herself in a modest-sized house.  She has not talked with my mom, her daughter, in many years - I'd say at minimum 8 years.  I never really recognized the problems but it all started making sense when she would never step foot in our house when my mom was home.  My mom has always let me see my grandmother because she didn't want her problems to ruin my only chance at having a grandmother (both my grandparents on my other side died when before I was born).  \n\nShe has another daughter, my aunt Rita, who has her own set of issues.  Growing up, I perceived my aunt and uncle to be extremely successful because they always had the nicest cars, the biggest houses, and went on the best vacations.  Turns out my uncle was embezzling money and involved in other fraudulent activity to pay for this and he went to jail and they divorced. \n\nMy aunt has gone on thru 2 more serious relationships since her first marriage (1 guy she married, 1 where she moved in with the boyfriend).  The first guy, whom she married then divorced, went bankrupt. The second guy, whom she moved in with into a nice house, got in a massive fight with her where the police were called and he also went bankrupt.  Her current boyfriend is much older than her (late 60s) but doesn't seem to have as much money as the other 3 and she doesn't live with him. Right now, my grandmother is paying the rent for my aunt's apartment and she (Rita) does not work.  Her current boyfriend drunkenly told us at Christmas that she has been trying to get him to buy life insurance and name her the benefactor, which just make that of what you will. \n\n\n\nWith that background in place, let me explain the current situation.  My dad was at my grandmother's the other day and just told me that she named him the executor of her will and that I will receive her inheritance.  It's not much, but I mean she's basically giving me a house to sell which will pay my student loans and maybe help put a down payment on my own house in the future.  \n\nI guess the news got out sooner to my aunt because my grandmother told my dad that my aunt Rita told my grandmother that I said, \"I hate her,\" and that, \"she needs to die sooner so I can get more money,\" among other things. (jesus christ that's the most he-said, she-said sentence I've ever written. I've re-read that sentence 3 times to make sure I got it right). \n\nI obviously have never said these things because I had no idea before tonight that I was even getting an inheritance.  Even now I don't think I necessarily deserve it.  But it clearly seems like my aunt is trying to destroy any relationship I have with my grandmother before she dies so that maybe the will can be rewritten and that she will get everything instead. BTW my mom never personally expected to get anything and has no problems with me getting it. \n\nI don't care about or feel entitled to this inheritance at all.  My mom's side of the family has always been super messed up and I hate that I am now being thrown into this all because of money.  I don't even know how to settle this situation because I am afraid my grandmother might eventually believe that I said these horrible things due to her own issues, especially as she gets older.  Is there a way I can go about solving this without everyone hating me in the end?  I'm guessing no and that my aunt will forever resent me if I end up receiving the inheritance. \n\n\n**TL;DR: My grandmother named me the benefactor of her inheritance so my aunt is making up things that I said about her in an effort to tank our relationship, most likely to get the will re-written.**"}, {"comments": ["They need to apologize directly.

All of them have reached out to me with weak apologies full of justifications. I asked my mom if she had apologized to Sammy, and my mom said I could pass on the apology. \n\nYeah ... that's not how this works. No mature, responsible adult should attempt to outsource damage control for their own poor behavior. \n\n**Not that it matters, from Sammy's perspective:** Each and every single one of your family members who was bad-mouthing your girlfriend owes her an apology. However, it's going to be extremely awkward for Sammy to have to accept them, and it also puts her in an unpleasant situation. If she forgives and begins to spend time with them again, she's going to feel like a doormat and will privately obsess over how much they might be faking it when they're nice to her. If she doesn't forgive them and keeps her distance, she may feel like a jerk for doing so. \n\nOption A is going to be awkward and uncomfortable for her at best, but at least she won't deprive you of your family. Option B is far more comfortable for her, but it also means that you're probably not going to see much of them either, and she'll be indirectly responsible for that.\n\n**Like I said: There's no truly clean resolution here.** On top of all the nasty gossiping they did, your family has really put Sammy in an awful situation.\n\nLong-term, this could play out in several very different ways depending on stuff that's hard to predict now. Over the short-term, if your family doesn't offer heartfelt apologies (or even if they do), I think it's best for you and Sammy to ghost them for a bit. If they do reach out, respond with polite indifference to any queries. Deflect questions. Be cordial but chilly. Keep your distance and respond with succinct, impersonal statements when necessary, and shut down conversations quickly:\n\n - \"(Sister), I think it's best if you make other arrangements for babysitting at present.\" Don't offer justifications or rationalizations for this. You don't owe her any.\n - \"No, (brother), this is not going to impact your job.\" Do not say anything to his co-workers. That would drag uninvolved parties into Sammy's humiliation and your family's dirty laundry, and you don't need to do it anyway to leave your brother uneasy about having shit-talked the person who got him his job.\n - \"Hi Mom and Dad. Thanks for the invitation, but we'll be spending Thanksgiving and Christmas on our own this year.\" Again, you owe them no explanation.\n\nAnd so on. If your family was at least somewhat close before all this went down, they're likely to get increasingly unnerved by this. Good! Actions have consequences. The responsibility for mending the damage is on their end, not yours.\n\nWhether any of them takes the next logical step and offers a full apology ... well, that's up in the air. But if they kick up a fuss or engage in self-important blather attempting to excuse or minimize what they did, just remind them: \n\n**\"Sammy can always lose the weight. You're always going to be someone who accepted her help and hospitality, gossiped about her behind her back, and then made excuses rather than apologizing.\"**\n\n", "It sounded like your Dad didn't 100% agree with the conversation (he defended her before you walked in) and that's why he will genuinely apologize.

Thanks for all the advice and support everyone! I have decided to take Sammy on a vacation for Thanksgiving. I'm on the phone with a very helpful guy that's trying to find me a hotel room that isn't booked for that weekend. No matter what happens, I think this is going to be a tradition I build with her for the future: a relaxing weekend to ourselves while everyone else is running around buying knock off iPads.  Also, I talked to my dad briefly last night. He's pretty horrified by everything and has agreed to come over and apologize to Sammy and do it when Sammy feels up to hearing it. I have told Sammy all of this since it happened. She knows I'm choosing her over my family and that I would choose her over anyone.**\n\nMy girlfriend, Sammy, and I have been together a bit over a year. She's absolutely wonderful; smart, attractive, driven, educated, kind and goofy. She's everything I've ever wanted. And up until last week, I thought my family felt the same way.\n\nLast week, I went to my parent's house for dinner. We get together as a family a few times a month. It's been a tradition with us for years now. Sammy usually joins us for these dinners, but had work obligations. I told my family she wouldn't be joining us that night. Halfway through dinner, I got up to go to the bathroom, and Sammy texted me that she was outside. She got off work early and came over to hang out. She would have normally walked in (which is normal) but she needed help bringing in some gifts. Sammy is leaving tomorrow for a work trip and a personal vacation to see some friends, so she won't be back until Thanksgiving. My brother and sister (twins) have their birthday next week, and my girlfriend had gifts for them. \n\nAt this point, my family had no idea Sammy was there. We walked inside and headed to the kitchen and we overheared my family talking.\n\nMy sister was saying that she was glad my girlfriend was gone because she couldn't stand a family night being ruined by my girlfriend being annoying. My brother and other sister agreed about how annoying and awful my girlfriend is. My dad made a comment about how they should be nice to Sammy. And my mom chimed in with, \"Sammy is nice and all but I can't believe familysuxthrow likes how fat she is, he can do so much better.\" My family, even my dad, agreed. And my sister piped up that I was dating down because I'm still rebounding from my last girlfriend (which was five years ago...)\n\nI was floored. My family has always been so nice to Sammy and I've never heard them talk badly about her. I've never heard my family say mean things about anyone, to be honest.\n\nSammy walked into the kitchen and dumped the presents on the counter. She was crying and mumbled something about happy birthday and then took off out the door. My family looked shocked and a bit embarrassed. I asked my family what the fuck was wrong with them and didn't stick around for an answer. I went after Sammy. She was in her car, crying. Now, Sammy is usually tough but family is super important to her. She has no family, aside from an alcoholic dad that she doesn't have any contact with. My family was like her surrogate family and something she always wanted. She was overjoyed when my family welcomed her and invited her to family events. The presents she brought my sister and brother were paintings she had spent many hours working on.\n\nAnd yes, she is fat. But, I prefer thick girls, always have. To me, she's gorgeous and exactly what I like. But even then, she's lost about 40 pounds since we started dating. I would love her at any weight and I'm proud of the work she's done. I have no idea what they mean about her being annoying. She comes when she's invited, usually brings baked goods or beer. She's taken my family out to dinner multiple times and is extremely generous with them. She's even become the go to babysitter for my sister and her two kids. And she helped my brother get a job in her company. She pushed really hard to get him hired and put her professional reputation on the line. She's never asked for repayment or holds it over anyone. She even does the dishes when we come over for dinner!\n\nThe thing that makes this even worse is I was planning on proposing to her in the next few months. I had planned on asking my sisters to come with me to pick out her ring.\n\nNow, Sammy hasn't said much about it and hasn't talked to me much about this incident. She has always wanted a family and she doesn't understand why my family doesn't like her or what she's done wrong. She said she'd talk to me more when she gets back from her trip. I don't want to lose her over this. I would take her over my family. Sammy hasn't been her usual cheerful self this week and I've caught her crying more than once since this incident. I try to comfort her but she tries to play it that she's fine.\n\nAt this point, I have no idea if I even want them in my life. All of them have reached out to me with weak apologies full of justifications. I asked my mom if she had apologized to Sammy, and my mom said I could pass on the apology. \n\nTo be fair to them, all of them do feel bad about what happened and seemed extra embarrassed about this. But no one can give me exact reasons why she's annoying or how she's ruined family nights. My dad is the only reasonable one that has offered to apologize to Sammy directly.\n\nWhat do I do? I don't want to get rid of my family, but Sammy matters more to me at this point.

I've never worked in clay before, let alone made figure sculptures out of it. Good clay was expensive at the store she recommended we go to, and it was a large heavy block so I was under the impression we didn't need to buy more. I just smashed all of my work when we were done, I didn't like them anyway. \n\nThere has been a piece here and there where my teacher (I'll say Mary) has asked if I want to fire them (put them in a furnace to harden them). I always said no, I need the clay from the piece because I can't afford to buy more. She assured me she has recycled clay, that I should keep some of my pieces, but I didn't want to. \n\nI'm also having a hard time financially. I work a job slightly above min wage, and I'm not given many hours. I'm struggling at that job, too, and that's been a great source of stress for me. \n\nI haven't been the biggest fan of Mary so far. She hasn't taught this class before, and for people who've never used clay in their life, I didn't feel like she explained enough about the medium, she just threw us in and got irritated when we didn't know what we were doing. When we ask for help (even if we don't ask), she shoves you aside and works on your piece. This includes tearing it out,  using tools to scratch at the clay, smashing more clay on to whatever you were working on. In my figure drawing class, the most that teacher would do was gesture with her finger what needed to be done. That's all. Mary also has given people shit for the whole semester. People ask innocent questions, and she answers in a mocking way. I was sitting in a chair once, because my clay was set up on something short, and she ranted about how we shouldn't be lazy and our sculptures aren't going to be good and we aren't good artists if we aren't standing with the model. She tried to make my sculpting stand taller, but then it was too tall, so I ended up sitting the rest of the class so I could reach my piece. Now, with the added impression that I'm lazy. She then said I should have gotten there earlier so I could get a sculpting stand that worked. \n\nToday, someone ran out of their clay. She has always said she has recycled clay, so I don't think anyone thought it would be a huge deal. After giving her a hard time, she went to check and came back saying she was out of recycled clay. She asked \"do your other art classes ask you to buy supplies?\" People said yes. \"Then it's no different here, you need to come to class prepared.\" Which is fine, but the bag of clay I bought at the beginning of the semester was $20. I felt bad for the girl who had no clay now, but when I went to get my clay out I found that it had hardened in my locker over the weekend. I've seen her help someone whose clay hardened before, so I asked for her help. \n\nShe gets PISSED. She goes to say something to me, stops, then starts pacing around the room. \"Are you guys adults? Like, are you? I am DONE talking to you guys about your clay, you need to grow up and sort it out yourself. You need to go buy more clay, it's $10 at the bookstore.\" I never knew it was cheaper there, but I literally have no money this week. She looks at me and tells me specifically to go buy more clay. I ask, \"right now?\" She says, \"unless you're just going to sit there all day.\" \n\nI say I literally do not have the money to go buy clay. She stops, bends over, makes a dramatic frustrated noise and paces around some more. I'm bewildered because it's not like I KNEW my clay would be hard when I came back to class. I say I'm sorry, and she comes back asking if me and the other girl can share a bag of clay. The other girl says yes, and Mary says she is going to front us the money and buy us some clay, then storms out. \n\nI'm just sitting there, people staring at me and I can feel myself start to tear up. I usually try to be humorous in awkward situations, but when I went to speak the only thing I could say was \"great, I just had to admit to everyone that I don't have ten fucking dollars.\" I started to actually cry, so I just muttered that I should just leave, and grabbed my stuff. People said not to, that she was getting more clay, that they could give me money, but that just upset me more and I didn't want Mary to come back to me sobbing. I left. \n\nI realized I left my partner without someone to sculpt. I feel really bad, but I just didn't want to be around Mary anymore, and I didn't want to take anything from her. I would rather skip a day than owe her money. It also fucking sucks to know that I was once making good money at my last jobs, but I made the stupid decision of trying to find a non-seasonal job and now I'm fucking broke. I've been trying my hardest to keep up having a job and going to school, but I'm really struggling this semester and this didn't help. \n\nI guess my question is now what do I do? I really don't want to face her again, and silently pretend nothing happened, but I would be wasting the entire semester so far to drop the class now. My fianc\u00e9 gets paid tomorrow, so if I ask him for money he will buy me more clay, but I feel shitty already asking him to pay for my share of the bills. And I don't want to come to class with a bag of new clay, because knowing her she would call me out saying I had the money all along.

Keep doing what you're doing, be there for her if and when she needs you and let her know that you're not going anywhere.

If it's only been a few days then yeah, let her grieve. This is hard and it's going to take a *long, long* time for her to feel \"normal\" (whatever that is) again. Even longer for her to feel beautiful. Of course, you and I know that nothing has changed, but that's not how she feels and she's entitled to that. She gets to be sad, angry, depressed, and emotional right now. \n\nHowever, if it's been some time and she's still not letting you see her then she might need a good ol' kick in the emotional ass.

In the meantime, he had tubes for dialysis and operations which meant big scars and a fistula that puffed the veins up in his arm to 100x their normal size with more scars... etc. You get the picture. Needless to say, he was feeling pretty shitty about himself and while I understood where he was coming from, just like you, I still thought he was as handsome and sexy as ever. \n\nHe grieved too and I waited for him, offering support in anyway that I could. When he needed space I gave it too him and when he needed a shoulder to cry on, mine was right there waiting. But after some time went by, I could tell he wasn't letting the \"I'm a hideous, unattractive freak now\" thing go. So I sat him down and told him that I understood that he *felt* unattractive, and that **he** thought he was ugly, but it was completely unfair to push his thoughts and feelings on to me. ***I*** didn't and couldn't possibly ever find him unattractive. \n\nObviously, use your judgement here and give her the time she needs. But remember that part of loving someone is pulling them up and letting them lean on your when they can't make the journey alone. A time will come when you'll need to lean on her, but for now she needs you to be a rock for her. Rocks don't move and make sure she knows that you aren't going to either.\n\nEdit: mobile typos, autocorrect"], "edited": true, "id": "5h3hnx", "body": "So last month, my girlfriend got in a fight with another girl.

"], "edited": false, "id": "4vopg1", "body": "This is my first time posting here but I would greatly appreciate some insight into my situation from people who are outside of it. I [32F] have been married to my Minister husband [37M] for 7 years when I found out that he had been having an affair with a member of his congregation [35F] and she has become pregnant. Despite his words and begging me to forgive him I have chosen to file for divorce. It was difficult because I had been married to him for so long, 7 years, and we had a 2 year courtship before we were married. He has been in my life a long time but despite him asking I could not forget the affair. He now lives with the woman he had an affair with and their child and he was removed from his job as the Minister once the affair became public. I am renting a townhouse and am working a full time job now.\n\nThe problem I am having is that many of the people in the town and in the church still see me as the Minister's wife. My husband was the Minister for 5 years and I often prayed with and supported people during difficult times, such as during the sickness or death of a loved one or during marital difficulties. Even though I have filed for divorce and am no long living with my husband, these people are still asking me to carry out these duties. I do care for these people but because I am now working full time I no longer have the time that I used to. It doesn't help that the Minister who replaced my husband is unmarried and there is no wife for them to go to in my place. I do not mind attending the odd charitable event in my spare time or visiting occasionally to have tea or pray but I cannot do this all the time like I used to. The people from the town and the church have been nothing but kind to me from the outset of this instead of encouraging me to stay with my husband, and I truly do not believe they are doing this out of malice, but I don't know what else I can do. I have gently reminded them that I am no longer the Minister's wife but they either don't listen or say things like \"I don't mind dear\". I don't want to be angry, rude or forceful because as I said they are not doing it because they are bad people. I believe they are just so used to me doing it that it's comfort for them. How can I can I kindly, gently and nicely get them to stop treating me like I am the Minister's wife? Thank you everyone for your time.\n\ntl;dr summary: My [32F] husband [37M] was the Minister of the church for five years until he was removed because he had an affair with a member of his congregation [35F]. I have filed for divorce and the church has a new (unmarried) Minister. People still ask me to do the things I did when I was the Minister\u2019s wife (such as charitable endeavors, visiting their sick loved ones etc.) and even though they are not malicious they don\u2019t listen when I say no or ask them to stop, I think because they are so used to it and the new Minister is unmarried.

Fair enough. \n\nSo Jenny had her son on exactly Ada's 18th birthday. Ada was understandably upset about the whole thing. Jenny at one point told Ada that \"I hope you're not upset that we won't be celebrating your birthdays anymore\".

If she had moved the party a few days around I'm sure most people would have attended it.\n\nNow Jenny expects us all to apologize to her and promise that from now on we won't let her down like that. I don't think anyone has anything to apologize for and I don't think that anyone has let her down. By doing things like that she's setting herself up to be let down.\n\nSo what should we do?

I used to work in the legal field, so here are some suggestions for things you should talk about with your lawyer ASAP:\n\n1. I'm getting the sense that you're a SAHM. If that's true, ask your attorney to file a motion for interim financial support. Basically, this would require Mark to continue paying certain household expenses while the divorce is pending.\n2. Although Mark has said he will relinquish custody, you might want to ask your lawyer to file a motion for interim custody just to be safe. This will establish the custody arrangement for while the divorce is pending. Keep in mind that Mark will have legal rights as a parent to the twins until a court sets up an alternate arrangement.\n3. If you have joint assets (bank accounts, house, cars, etc.) ask your attorney about ways to keep Mark from running away with them if he decides to play dirty. She can file motions to prevent this from happening. Have her do the same thing for any accounts you have in the twins' names as well.\n\n\nOther things: \n\n1. Put the twins in counseling, the sooner the better. They are going to be sad, angry, and confused, and they need a safe space to discuss that. Your pediatrician can probably recommend someone. \n2. Find yourself a safe space, too, be it counseling, a good friend, your church, etc. You are going to need a place to talk these things out also. \n3. Try to keep the twins' lives as normal as possible. They should still go to school and activities, visit family and friends, have the same bedtime routine, etc. At this age kids are terrified of change, and you need to help them understand that their entire lives aren't going to change. \n\nI'm sorry, OP. THere's nothing about this that doesn't suck, is there? Take good care of yourself. \n", "Damn. That's amazingly rough. And I don't think there's any easy fix. But you are in NO WAY at fault in any of this.\n\nYour husband can't control what he feels, but he could have talked to you much, much sooner about this. If he had come to you about these feelings months ago--years ago!--you could've gone to a counselor, discussed how to address them, or done any number of things to try to resolve the issue. The fact that he didn't tell you the truth until he had already decided to break for it was the coward's way out. Not only once he'd signed a lease on the new apartment, but right before going on a business trip, so that you can't even talk to him about it! It's appalling behavior.\n\nBut he's shown that he's that kind of person, and how set he is in being that kind of person. You can't change that. And you're right that your children are too young to hear the reasons why their father left him.\n\nGet a lawyer of your own; your husband says now that he wants to give you a good deal, but you CANNOT count on that holding true once the legal machinery starts grinding. Your lawyer can give you advice on how to talk to your children, and/or point you towards a therapist who can help you with that. There are probably support groups for newly single mothers out there, too.\n\nYou should tell your family the truth about what your husband said, if you're on good terms with them. It will be far too painful if they keep trying to 'fix' the problem or jumping to conclusions about what happened based on incorrect assumptions.\n\nI am so sorry.

We have twin 5 year olds, Marie and Danny.  Mark always said he wanted to be a dad and when we had the twins we were happy.  It was also kind of perfect as a one and done- we wanted 2 or 3 kids and after the twins were born we decided that we were happy with 2.  We talked about Mark getting a vasectomy or me getting my tubes tied when the twins were toddlers but Mark said no to both because he thought we might want to have another kid when the twins were older, so I got an iud.  A couple times over the past few years, we've talked about having another baby, but we've always decided that 2 is a good number for us.\n\nMark is a fantastic dad, very hands on since day one.  The twins think he hung the moon and when they did a \"what I want to be when I grow up\" project at their preschool, Marie said she wanted to be her daddy when she grows up.  Mark never gets frustrated with them and has much more patience than I do.  About six months ago, I heard him talking to my brother who was about to become a dad and I heard him say \"being a dad is the first thing I've done in my life that I know I was meant to do and that I'm doing right\" and I thought in that moment that my life was as close to perfect as it could be.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mark was packing for a business trip he has had scheduled for a few months.  He said he wanted to have a date night before he left.  We normally have 2 date nights a month on weekends but I figured he wanted to do it because he was leaving for a week and he only travels for work twice a year.  We got a sitter and went out to dinner.  At dinner, Mark blindsided me.  He said that when he gets back he's moving into an apartment he's found and signed a lease for.  He's going to be filing for divorce and has already retained a lawyer.  He said that he wants to be very fair to me in the divorce because he does still care for me but he can't stay married anymore. I was stunned and I asked him why.  He said it's because he hates everything about being a father.  He thought he wanted kids when I got pregnant but it's been horrible since the twins were born.  He said he got through the infant and toddler years by gritting his teeth and saying it was just a phase and would get better but it hasn't.  He said that he's tried to \"fake it til it's real\" but he hates every minute of fatherhood.  He said that he said all the right things and went above and beyond hoping that those feelings would pass.  I asked him why he was so opposed to getting a vasectomy or me getting my tubes tied if he hated fatherhood and he said that he had hoped he would change his mind and fall in love with his kids and want another one but that hasn't happened.  He said that he doesn't want visitation, he will pay child support and will sign over his rights if I meet someone else who wants to adopt them.  He said that in a world where the twins were never born, we would have stayed married for our whole lives but since we don't live in that world he needs to take care of himself since he's drowning being a dad. He paid the dinner bill, dropped me off at home, went and stayed in a hotel then left on his trip.\n\nI haven't talked to him since that night.  The twins ask why they can't talk to him but I told them it's because where daddy is right now is the opposite of us and he's asleep when we're awake (that's true, where he is for work is 11 hours ahead of us).  They ask everyday when he's coming home and I say soon.  I'm meeting with a lawyer on Tuesday but I can't think straight.  My marriage and family is so important to me and I don't know what to do or think.  I've talked to Mark's mom about some prearranged childcare stuff and don't think she knows anything.  No one in my family has ever gotten a divorce, because everyone has managed to have a happy marriage.  I feel like such a failure and I don't even know what to tell my kids.  I'm so afraid that they'll resent me and I can't imagine explaining to them that their father never wants to see them again and hopes to be able to give up his rights someday.  What do I do reddit?

I am Greek and she is Italian. She was the secretary of a business woman we visited with my boss 8 years ago in Italy, it was something like... love at first sight as they say. Nothing really happened between me and her back then, but we kept in touch through the internet and liked each other a lot. Things escalated and lead us to a long distance relationship. Despite the discouragement of everybody that it will not work and that we should stop wasting our time (and mostly from her parents because she is older than me and a few years with a man that wouldn't end up being with her could be an utter waste of time), we managed to endure the distance (we travelled to each other regularly) and eventually make it work. We are now living happily married in a wonderful city of northern Greece and we enjoy every bit of it.\n\nOf course, our relationship has its ups and downs, but we never really had a big trust issue between us since the foundations of our relationship were honesty, trust, loyalty and fidelity. Before i met Valeria (my wife), i was in another long distance relationship with a Dutch woman, Larisa. I broke up with Larisa 8 months before meeting Valeria, and Valeria had full knowledge of my previous relationship and all the details - pretty much anything that happened between me and Larisa, why we broke up, what went wrong, etc etc.\n\nOur lives with Valeria were peaceful until 3 years ago that we received a weird mail from the Netherlands. We were both surprised because we weren't really expecting anything, and the package/box had only my name written on it. After opening it we realized that it had some (not all, you'll see later) of my older belongings that i had left in the Netherlands (t-shirts that she kept everytime we met to feel me close to her while we would split again, everyday stuff, a perfume of mine, stuff like that). We were both shocked, but Valeria looked way more worried than me. She never felt comfortable hearing anything about my ex-gf, although she was the one to bring her up in the conversation. That used to happen in our first few months together. She would ask me questions about her and i could happily answer them since i was over her and it didn't hurt, but on the contrary, it hurt Valeria, but she kept getting back at it.\n\nFast forward to July 2016, we have had plenty of these packages delivered to us. After the first few, she started adding notes in the packages and old pictures of us when we were together. Valeria was boiling. I even told the post office to block any incoming mail from Larisa but they said it was against their policy (???) and all mail was eventually delivered to us no matter what.\n\nDuring the last week of July, i had to travel for business purposes with my boss and a few colleagues to Belgium and the Netherlands. Valeria didn't say anything about me going to the Netherlands although i did expect her to. Everything went fine, nothing important to mention until last Monday.\n\nTwo days ago we received another mail, but this time the package has Valeria's name on it. Without any surprise we figure out it's from Larisa. This time it wasn't a big box though, it was just an envelope. It contained pictures of me with Larisa, and they looked really recent. The pictures were pretty intimate to be honest, but they were CLEARLY photoshopped. Some of these pictures, judging by the poses of mine, were taken from social media, but others just look totally unfamiliar to me. Needless to say Valeria was so shaken she almost fainted. After she calmed down, she looked at me furiously and a few seconds later she started crying relentlessly. I tried to explain that i did not meet Larisa and that these pictures were clearly edited. She asked me then how did Larisa know that i was in the Netherlands these specific days, which is an excellent question. The only ones that knew i would be in the Netherlands these days were my close friends, colleagues and of course my wife. Valeria said she wanted  to think, she starting packing a couple of clothes and she told me she would stay in a hotel for a couple of days. I stopped her and packed a few clothes of mine and moved to a hotel myself and have been staying there for the last 2 and a half days.\n\nAs obvious as it is, this thing is burning me on the inside. I feel shattered that things have turned like that. I feel totally devastated that my wife doesn't trust me, but i can partly undertand her, since this obsessive mailing that was perpetuating through the last few years might have finally tricked her mind. There is a great question though: How did Larisa know i was in the Netherlands these certain days? There are no chances that she mailed these intimate photoshopped pictures by coinsidence. \n\nSo reddit, sorry for the long post, but what do i do now? How do i convince my wife that nothing has happened? Do i proceed to talk to her ... maybe today, or do i keep leaving her on her own space for as long as she needs? I think i am so stressed that i am having panic attacks all the time thinking of all the possible bad outcomes, and i am filled with unlimited anger and hate towards my ex-gf. I just want everything to be right with Valeria, i love her more than my own self and i would give the world to make her happy. I don't want to see her like that. This really feels like someone is trying to set something up on me.\n\n  ---   \n\n**Edit/Update** : Fixed some typos. Wow, this has totally blown up, i'm stunned. I am overwhelmed by the advices and the support.\nI'm trying to read every comment and reply where i feel like it is needed.\nAs a summary, your advice is mostly as it follows:\n1) Contact a lawyer/police and see what i can do legally against Larisa, such as have a cease and desist letter sent to her or a restraining order.\n2) To show the real pictures to her, the ones that were used as photoshop material.\n3) Secure social media accounts, lock down stuff. Make sure no security breaches have occured and to try to make info harder to find.\n\nSo, **update** regarding legal issues:\n\nI just contacted a good lawyer friend of mine. Well, kind of a silly move since i haven't spoken to him for years, but he gladly helped me. He told me that there is absolutely nothing illegal Larisa has done. Note to many of you: do remember that i am Greek and Larisa (the woman that is harassing me and my wife) is Dutch. There aren't even any common European union laws that we both have to obey that give me any ground to press any charges on her. She has practically done nothing wrong. And even if we were not living in different countries, it would still be hard to get a restraining order on somebody just because of some mails. So, all in all, we are powerless legally. He pretty much says that all we can do is send a legal note to her saying that any form of contact with us (mail, e-mail, phone call, text message, anything) is not desirable and that it is going to be delivered instantly back to her unopened. Also, we contacted the Hellenic Post Office and this time they took my request to not receive any mail by the said person in a more serious regard since i was accompanied by a lawyer. They said they will fulfill my desire to not receive any mail and will contact me once again the next few days for more details.\n\nAnd now **more important update** regarding me and Valeria! :\n\nI was encouraged by your comments and i decided to give my wife a call. She picked up and i was so relieved. We had a small and quick talk on how we are doing and if we are ok, and we decided that we had enough of that shit and that we should talk about everything that is bothering us. She sounded ... ok. I expected her to sound bitter or anything like that, but she sounded really ok on the phone. We arranged to meet in 1 hour and 15 minutes to our favourite place, downtown in the pedestrial area right by the sea. I was really nervous before calling but now i feel more relieved, i hope everything's going to be alright and i have a feeling it really is going to be like that. Fingers crossed i guess... I'll post an update in this post or maybe on a new \"Update\" post after we meet.\n\nAnd something else. There's a few people saying that i did indeed meet Larisa and now i'm trying to cover my shit. I mean, i personally cannot see why i would make this post if i had indeed met Larisa. And if i had, why would i not tell you the truth and ask for advice, admitting that i had screwed up? Makes no sence to me, but maybe that's just me. Perhaps i'm too naive or not demonic enough to see the reason to do something like that.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your support everyone, i'll keep you posted.\n\n**Edit2**: So something regarding Larisa. I'm glad another redditor asked me why would she harass me or if there was any reason behind that. Well, me and Larisa didn't break up very peacefully. I mean, the breakup itself was \"okay\". Mind you, it was a relationship that started with Larisa's initiative, she was the one that made the first step in everything, literally everything. After meeting a few times (we both travelled to each other), she decided that she wanted to break up with me. She didn't really want me anymore. Larisa figured that she was not really physically attracted to me (for example, she wanted me taller.. Dutch women are tall, and i wasn't tall enough for her. She was 179cm and i was 183cm but that was not enough for her. That's one of many things she didn't like about me apparently). I truly loved her, and this is why i decided to respect her decision, to accept that we are over and to move on. She didn't like that i cut contact with her though. Larisa has been suffering from anxiety. After i cut contact with her she would sent me really bitter messages saying stuff like \"I do not need you anymore. You were not needed in my life and i am strong enough by myself. You were wrong\", you get the idea. I never said or implied that she needed me anyway. Needless to say she convinved her whole family that i did say or imply those things. Well, that kept going on for a while until a point that she just stopped. The very last message was a very bitter and resentful message saying stuff like \"good luck to your next victim, i hope she realizes her mistake fast enough so that she can save that time being with a loser and coward like you\". I mean ... ok. She wasn't really friendly....\n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Ex-gf of mine tricked my wife by sending fake pictures of me and her to my wife.

His dad (50sM) has always been an issue for me. At first I thought it was because I've been no contact with my own father, an abuser about whom I could write pages about the shit he put me and my family through, but I slowly realized that he's an asshole in his own right. Racist, ignorant, and a convicted wife-beater to boot. Recovering alcoholic, etc. I get along *very* well with my MIL(50sF), though, and consider her a dear friend.\n\nWe had our first child this last month. My daughter is perfect. From the moment I found out about her, she became my heart. My husband and I were absolutely and completely besotted, even before she was born. No one except our moms knew for the first three months (I have a history of pregnancy loss) and he took this personally, citing my \"issues with men\" to my DH. Even to the point of my FIL telling my husband that the \"real reason\" we didn't want to find out about the sex of the baby because if it was a boy I'd probably abort (side note- I'm extremely close to my stepdad, brother and many other male relatives and have no issue with men, just abusers regardless of sex). \n\nThe pregnancy was hard on me. I didn't gain enough weight, was on and off bed rest due to cramping and bleeding. Ended up going to 43 weeks, which was a miracle in and of itself, and was cleared for a natural birth. Of course, FIL bitched about it, said that if a c-section was good enough for MIL (who has major medical issues leading to my DH being her only child and a planned c-section leading to a hysterectomy) it should be good enough for me, that this baby would die (which hurt like hell because of my previous losses, about which he knew), that the longer I stayed pregnant the fatter I'd get (note- I was underweight my whole pregnancy) and the less attracted to me my husband would be, and a million other nasties. \n\nI finally went into labor three weeks ago. Unmedicated, in a hospital but with a midwife. Was long and horrible and one of the best choices I've ever made. About 13 hours in, FIL and MIL decide to burst in. NOPE. I've told the hospital not to let anyone in (I don't want my own father and stepmother even knowing about my daughter let alone coming to the birth). \n\nI flip a shit. Maybe it was being 13 hours into labor with an 11lb baby. Maybe it was just the piles of horrible abusive shit he's been shoveling onto me and my husband and my MIL for as long as any of us have known him. But I completely lose it. Tell him to get his abusive ass out, tell him that nothing is coming out of my ladybits with him in there so if he wants to meet his grandbaby, he needs to scram. Basically the sort of yelling you'd expect from a woman 13 hours into labor who is faced with someone she deeply dislikes but tolerates for her husband's sake.\n\nHe turns purple and goes at me, hand raised, before he realizes where he is. My husband grabs him, has him in a chokehold (husband has a good 50lbs and 6in on him). I think my husband would've killed him if hospital security hadn't taken him out. With just my husband, mother and MIL in the room, the baby came within two more hours, after interventions- the stress from the encounter caused my daughter to go into distress, and myself to completely panic and shut down. The opposite of what was needed in labor, in short.\n\nSo... what do I do now? What do we do now? I want to go no contact, but that would mean losing contact with my MIL with whom I get along well, and my husband  losing his parents, plus my daughter never knowing any grandparents but my mom due to my dad not being in my life. What do I do?\n\nTL;DR: FIL is an abusive ass and took a swing at me **while I was in labor**. Don't know where to go from here. \n\nEDIT: Fixed some statements to make it obvious that no, I would not abort due to the sex of the baby. \n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3oxzfq/update_my_fil_50sm_took_a_swing_at_me_24f_while_i/)"}, {"comments": ["Your story brought tears to my eyes.

We've been together 4 years and in the beginning it was mostly about sex. We met online. She'd never been with a native dude and I'd never been with a white girl. \n\nIt didn't take long at all for me to fall for her. She's funny and witty and so smart. Way smarter than I could ever dream to be. It doesn't hurt that she's incredibly beautiful either. 10/10 in my books. She's just a wonderful person inside and out.\n\nI struggled a lot before I met her. I lived on the reserve. Alcoholism is rampant there and I was not an exception. My ex and I even lost custody of our son and daughter because we couldn't keep our shit together. Currently my kids are [11M and 9F]. I wasn't even working when I met my gf since I was in such a bad place.\n\nI started drinking very young 13, maybe 14 and it feels like I just never stopped. I tried quitting around the birth of my first born at least half a million times. I'd only make it a few days until the detox was absolutely unbearable and I'd give into the craving. I wanted so badly to change for him, to be a good daddy but ultimately I failed him miserably. I failed my daughter too.\n\nI don't know what my gf saw in me when she met me. I was a failure of a human being. She was the first person in my whole entire life to call me on my bullshit though. She told me I was a deadbeat dad. She told me my drinking was a huge issue. She said countless hurtful things, yet they were all very true. I was exactly the person she said I was.\n\nIt was barely a month into meeting her that I showed up at her house incredibly drunk and had a full on meltdown. I just cried like I'd never cried before and I basically admitted to all the terrible things she said I was. I told her I didn't want to be that person. I didn't want to be me.\n\nIt's all a vague and blurry memory but I can remember her just hugging me and crying with me and I don't think I'd ever felt that kind of compassion before her. I don't think I ever truly felt cared about in the way she cared about me. \n\nThe next morning she asked if I wanted help. She said she'd figure everything out for me if I wanted help. I did want help. \n\nShe got me into detox which was a fucking nightmare. Then I went to rehab where she visited as often as they allowed. Then instead of going back home to the reserve she asked if I wanted to stay with her. She along with my therapist didn't think going  back home would be at all good for my sobriety. \n\nI've lived with her ever since. She even helped me get a job, albeit for her dad's company. If anything that gave me even more incentive not to fuck it up since I wanted to make a good impression. After that I was allowed a lot more visitation with my kids and then about a year into my sobriety I was given custody back. Again my gf went above and beyond by letting them move into her home.\n\nShe has been an amazing mother figure to them over the last three years of us all living together. The kids love her. I love her. Her family has been great with the kids too. Never treated them like outsiders. They've been given the best Christmases and birthdays because of these people. I've never felt anything but warmth and acceptance from all of them which I know deep down I don't deserve.\n\nI want to marry her, but that's where all the doubt starts to come into play.

I don't want her to look back in 10 years and wish she never met me. I wish I could have as big and amazing impact on her life as she did mine, but instead I feel like I can only bring her down.\n\nI know we get looks sometimes when we're out too. I know people wonder why she's with someone like me. Her friends were always very vocal about me being a huge mistake. That I'll only cause trouble in her life/that I'm using her. To this day they say she could do better. They're not wrong about the better part.\n\nSometimes I can't help but wish I was born white. Things would've been so much different.

We had a party at home with 20 or so friends of family, R was of course present at the party, along with a few other members of BFs family. \n\nThe party was going reasonably well, as it started to get later I started to get a little tipsy, and most of the guests had started to go home. It eventually got down to a drunken little group made up of myself, boyfriend, R and a couple of my girlfriends. \n\nWe were sitting outside and one of my girlfriends decided to get on the trampoline, she managed to execute a pretty cool flip, and I expressed that I wished I knew how to do one. \n\nMy friend talked me into giving it a try. I got up on the tramp, stumbled drunkenly and fell down laughing. Everyone else (except for BF) was laughing also. It didn't seem like much of an event until BF got up, muttered \"fucking pathetic\" in an angry tone and then told me that we needed to speak in private. \n\n\nI was pretty confused as to what was going on, so I asked him \"why?\"- he answered me with \"Just stop being a stupid cow for a second and come to the bedroom\" \n\nBoth of my friends and R looked pretty shocked at this, but I before I followed BF to the bedroom I told them it was fine and BF was probably just messing around. He can have a real temper sometimes, particularly after a few drinks but I didn't think that would be the case in this instance as literally NOTHING upsetting had happened. \n\n\nCut to me and BF in the bedroom. He shuts the door and starts really going off. He tells me that I'm a disgusting drunk idiot and that I was showing off like some kind of pathetic wannabe by messing around on the trampoline. That I was an embarrassment to him and that I was to go to bed now and not leave the room until morning so that I would be more of an idiot in front of company. \n\n\nAs this is going on he is getting louder and louder and is slamming things around the room. I went to leave as I was quite upset at this point, but he blocks the door so I sit down on the bed. \n\n\nR is banging on the door and tells BF to open in. BF goes out into the hall and I can hear he and R arguing. Next thing I know it R comes into the room and says to go with him. I was sobbing like crazy at this point, because I hate confrontation in general, so I just nod and go with him. \n\nR makes sure my other friends have left and then we both get into a taxi. I don't know where BF has gone but he is still in the house sow where. \n\nI'm crying a bunch in the car and don't say much, but R calls his and BFs mother and gives her a brief rundown of what happened. \n\nWe got to R's place, he lives with a couple and they were all really nice. The girl roomate leant me some stuff to sleep in and R told me to take his bed and he would sleep on the couch. I was kind of all over the place but eventually got some sleep. \n\nNext morning I got up and had coffee with R and one of his roommates. R asked if BF had behaved that way before and I let him know about BFs temper but explained that he had never blown up over something as insignificant as me mucking around on a trampoline. I asked R if he thought maybe I did or said something that might have upset BF and didn't realise due to being tipsy, but R said no, and that BFs behaviour was unacceptable. \n\n\nI felt silly and embarrassed, especially knowing that R and my friends had heard everything BF had said, and I told R I had better get home and try to sort things out. \n\nR said that he wanted to stay at his place for just a bit longer to calm down, and that he would really rather prefer that I didn't go home straight away as BF could still be angry. \n\nI gave in an hung out there with R and his roommates, we all just played video games and got some takeout, and I ended up feeling much better afterward- so I'm glad I stayed. \n\nEarly evening a told R I should really go home, I didn't have any of my clothes and more importantly I needed my stuff for university the next day. He drove me over, but didn't really want me to go inside. I told him it would really be fine and promised I would call him if anything happened. \n\nHe agreed but said he would wait outside for a few minutes just in case. \n\nI got inside and BF wasn't home so I told R to go and went about tidying up from the party. \n\nBF eventually rocked up and seemed calm enough. I told him I thought we needed to have a talk and he agreed. \n\nWe sat down on the couch and I explained to him that I didn't think the way he spoke to me last night and asked for an explanation. \n\nHis response was \"I will discuss that with you after you delete R's phone number, you won't be speaking to him again\" \n\nI was confused as all hell at this and asked what that had to do with the matter at hand. \n\nHe told me that R disrespected him by interfering in our relationship, and that we were cutting ties with him. He told me he wouldn't discuss anything else about the night before until I did that. \n\nI told BF I thought that was pretty unnecessary, and that R had been trying to help me because BF was acting really threatening, and that I would have probably done the same in R's shoes. \n\nWell, BF did not like that. He yelled, called me some names and left the house. After a few hours he sent me a text \n\n\"I am sorry for yelling, but you need to respect what I want if you want the same in return. This can't be one sided. Delete R's number and we will finish the conversation. Love you\" \n\n\nI replied that I needed a little time to think and said I would be sleeping in the spare room when he got home and to please leave me some for a while. \n\nI went to bed, heard BF come in very late. He opened the door to the spare room and turned the light on, but as I woke up he just walked out of the room and slammed the door. \n\nSo this morning I've woken up, BF is at work and I have a text from R, it says- \n\nHey **** , I hope you're ok. Look what BF did the other night is really not alright and I think you should get out of there for a while. I've talked to.  **** and **** and it's totally fine for you to crash here until you figure out what you want to do\n\n\nSo that leaves me where I am now. Don't know what to do about the situation- do as BF asks and cut contact with R, or take R's offer of some space away from BF to clear my head. My worry is that if I stay at R's that will destroy any chance of fixing things with BF. Advice very much appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Boyfriends brother spoke up and took me away when BF was blowing up about something fairly small.

I strongly advice against just ignoring what she said about your father and continuing life as normal. You don't have to have a relationship with her, you can just finish out school and then move out when you're 18 or move in with your father now. Also, if you decide to confront her about what she said, prepare yourself for her excuses and lies that she will use to deflect guilt off of herself.

We didn\u2019t know what else to think, so we took his word for it. \n\nFor roughly a week, Linda didn\u2019t talk to us, but eventually she came around and apologized. She said she didn\u2019t want to get off on the wrong foot with us. She brought Sam with her again and wanted him to get to know Gianna. The only interaction they had shared at that point was waiting at the bus stop together, and Linda wanted them to spend some time together today. I always ask Gianna if she\u2019s okay with these kinds of things before they happen, and she gave me a look that said she basically didn\u2019t give a shit about spending an hour with Sam. They went outside to play, and Linda invited me over to her house for coffee.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, Linda made a comment to me about what Gianna said to her last week, telling her that our past was none of her business. She thought Gianna had been rude and disrespectful. I don\u2019t know if all kids are like this, but Gianna often tells it like it is. She doesn\u2019t behave that way to purposely antagonize anyone, however. I explained to Linda that Gianna is pretty straight up about what she thinks, and that she didn\u2019t mean to provoke her on purpose. I didn\u2019t apologize for what Gianna said, though, because I agree with Gianna that our past is none of Linda\u2019s business. It seemed like Linda was expecting me to apologize, and when I didn\u2019t, she looked intensely bothered. She quickly changed the subject, however, and she started to blab about the \u201cfunny things\u201d that Sam says. I won\u2019t go into detail on that because it\u2019ll bore everyone to death, but I\u2019ll just say that from her stories that Sam seems like a problematic kid. Spoiled, mouthy, badly behaved, etc. I also learned that Linda seems hell-bent on presenting her family as picture perfect as she possibly can. She has an older son and an older daughter who I\u2019ve never seen but from her account are the best kids to ever walk this Earth. She seems like a major perfectionist to me. \n\nAfter the hour at Linda\u2019s, I went back home and found Gianna in the kitchen. I asked her how Sam was, and she said he was fine. She added \u201cHe\u2019s a total brat, but I can deal with him!\u201d when she saw the surprised look on my face, as I hadn\u2019t expected him to be just \u201cfine\u201d. Gianna is a pretty resilient little kid, though, so I trusted her to take care of herself when Sam is around. \n\nA few days later, Linda brought over her husband and Sam\u2019s father \u201cJim\u201d for us to meet. He had just returned from a business trip and he was heading off on another one in a few days, so Linda didn\u2019t want his opportunity to meet us to slip away. He seemed 100% disengaged throughout my entire conversation with him. He kept checking his phone, and at one point he stepped out of the room to take a call. I inferred from this behavior that he\u2019s probably a very busy man. I don\u2019t really want to get to know him, though, because at one point he remarked that he was extremely relieved that Matt and I weren\u2019t partners. Yikes. \n\nAfter living next door to Linda and her family for about three months, it\u2019s become clear that Sam truly is a miniature piece of shit. At the bus stop, he pokes and flicks Gianna and doesn\u2019t relent until she yells at him to stop. On the bus, he sat behind her and kicked the seat constantly until the bus driver forced him to sit in the back of the bus. At school, they\u2019re in the same class, and on the first day she arrived he told the entire class that he saw her looking through his bedroom window the first night we moved in (obviously this is 100% bullshit), alienating her from the very start. During class, he steals her supplies, calls her names, etc. When they\u2019re at home and the neighborhood kids are around, he constantly makes fun of her and makes rude comments about her to the other kids. Gianna always tells me about these incidents before anyone else does, which I think is pretty irresponsible on the school\u2019s part and on our neighbors\u2019 part. I talked to both the bus driver and their teacher, and they said they would keep an eye on Sam, but I\u2019m pretty sure nothing will come of that. I tried talking to Linda a few times, but she just kept brushing me off, saying that \u201cIt\u2019s just what boys do\u201d and even suggesting that Sam may have a crush on Gianna. The neighbors said the same kind of stuff. I told Gianna this and she thought it was disgusting. Her response was \u201cOnly stupid people believe that. Boys who tease girls to show them that they like-like them need to find a different way.\u201d\n\nHowever, when Gianna and Sam aren\u2019t in school or when they aren\u2019t around other kids, Sam behaves completely differently. He comes over almost every single day asking Gianna if she wants to play. Strangely, Gianna usually says yes. I keep telling her that she doesn\u2019t have to play with him if she doesn\u2019t want to. He\u2019s a little asshole and doesn\u2019t even deserve to play with her. Honestly, I have no idea how this kid has friends. But she always insists that she\u2019s okay when she plays with him. She never comes home crying or upset after she spends time with him. Every time I ask her how their playing was, she says it was fine. If I press further, she tells me to stop worrying, so I take that as a sign that she\u2019s okay. \n\nI\u2019ve recently started keeping an eye on Gianna and Sam if I\u2019m around, and Sam behaves very oddly. He still teases her, but she teases him back, which seems to surprise him. On some days he\u2019s in a bad mood, and it shows in his conversations with Gianna. He complains endlessly, but Gianna is pretty patient with him, way more than I would be if I was a ten-year-old kid. But on other days he\u2019s cheery and friendly toward her, and they have a good time. Honestly, their relationship is a mystery to me. \n\nHowever, yesterday, I was in the kitchen cooking, and I overheard them yelling extremely loudly. I ran outside and found Gianna crying. Still sobbing, she told me had been playing on their Nintendo DSes, and Sam had lost their game to her for the third time in a row. He had grabbed her DS out of her hands and snapped it in two, breaking it. Her DS was the only valuable she owned. She yelled at him and he actually swung a fist at her. The punch didn\u2019t land, because she grabbed his arm in time, but since she\u2019s been physically abused in the past she was basically having an emotional breakdown. This was the last straw for me. I angrily told Sam he was no longer allowed to play with Gianna anymore. I didn\u2019t call him a fuckhole to his face, but I sure wanted to.\n\nSam ran inside crying. I took Gianna inside. A few minutes later Linda stormed into the house screaming like a banshee. She told me that Gianna was a horrible little girl and that she was not raised well in the slightest. She said she needed manners and that if she was her kid, she would be disciplined the proper way. I didn\u2019t even get a chance to explain to her that her son was the piece of shit, not Gianna, because she left before I could say a word. I have no idea what Sam said to his mom to provoke her response, but it was probably a huge lie. \n\nI spent the rest of the night taking care of Gianna. I cooked her favorite meal for dinner and we watched a movie together. I even laid down with her in her bed when she went to sleep. This morning I told her she didn\u2019t have to go to school if she didn\u2019t want to, but she said she was okay. \n\nThis afternoon, Gianna came running into the house after school. She told me that Sam came to school late today, and that he had a broken arm and a gigantic black eye. Even the teacher was shocked. The entire class kept asking him what happened, but all he said was that he had fallen down the stairs at home. When Gianna approached him at recess asking him if he was okay, he didn\u2019t respond and he walked away as quickly as he could. \nWhen I heard this, I instantly saw major red flags, and Gianna did too. But my question for you guys is, where should I go from here?\n \nMy initial instinct was to call the police. The reason I\u2019m hesitating is because the only evidence I have is Sam\u2019s appearance. Linda has NEVER, and I mean NEVER, shown any signs of physical or emotional abuse, and believe me, I know the signs. Perfectionism sometimes exists alongside emotional abuse, but I have never been around Linda when she hasn\u2019t showered her son with praise and affection. She constantly talks about how much she loves him, and she\u2019s involved as a parent leader in every single one of his activities. She will go to infinite lengths to defend him even when he fucks up, as I saw yesterday, and she seems to think that he can do no wrong. If the authorities show up at her doorstep, I have reason to believe that she would act perfectly sane about the entire situation, because appearance is everything to her. I\u2019m guessing that she\u2019ll act like everything is 100% a-OK, and once the authorities leave, she\u2019ll turn on me, or even worse, on my sister for telling me about Sam\u2019s condition. When she ran into the house yesterday to scream at me, I just thought she was a fucking crazy parent. After today, I have no clue what to think about her. \n\nI asked Gianna if Sam has ever shown any signs of going through abuse of any kind, and she said no. Whenever he complains (which is practically 24/7), it\u2019s never about his family. In fact, she said he never talks about his family. This only added to my confusion.\n\nSo, Reddit, what should I do? I am completely lost as to where to go from here. Matt hasn\u2019t returned from class yet, so I\u2019ll fill him in when he gets back, and hopefully I\u2019ll have some more background on Linda soon. Sam is a little shit, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean he deserves a broken arm and a black eye. \n\n**tl;dr**: Me and my little sister live next door to this crazy woman and her son. Her son and my sister have a weird relationship, but yesterday he triggered her and she was a wreck. His mom came over and exploded on me. Today her son came to school late with a broken arm and black eye. Unsure of how to proceed.\n\nEDIT: paragraph breaks"}, {"comments": ["Look.

This conversation did not go as well.  Rachel was very accusative and called me \"rude and inconsiderate\" to not invite them.  Steve then piled on and noted it was \"different\" in the case where they didn't invite me, since they had a much smaller wedding.  He was also surprised that I would hold a \"grudge\".\n\nI let them speak for a few more minutes before I stopped them and explained to them very clearly that I am not in charge of the full guest list, and that this guest list is roughly half of the guest list we wanted.   On top of that, based on cultural norms and other issues, we had to give priority to a lot of other family and friends.  And that despite whatever they think is \"different\" about their situation.  I have the same problem they do, just on a larger scale.  I then pointed out that while I don't hold a grudge, yes I was offended that I wasn't invited, and yes, it hurt a lot that other friends and distant relatives were invited when I was the only one who stepped up to keep Steve off the streets for months.\n\nI also pointed out that I found it tacky that they thought it appropriate to mention that I didn't give them a wedding gift (and completely disregarding the dinner).  I told them that while they were not explicitly invited, I was also not looking for them to provide me a gift, in line with common etiquette.  \n\nRachel was quiet for a few seconds and then she said, well.

In terms of the Pre-Wedding shower, and the more ethnic reception, we have some flexibility, but based on our discussion and the general rudeness and sense of condescension from both you and Steve, that no, I will not be extending an invitation.  The fact that you felt it appropriate to exclude me and Ellie from your celebrations but that you feel entitled and EXPECT us to invite you to ours without so much as a real apology...wow.   \n\nSteve just said Really? and then hung up.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the updates...i'm going to see what Andy has to say, I may end up inviting him and Liz since they both seem very conciliatory and understand my reasoning.  I'd be ok with stretching a bit to accommodate them.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nHello Reddit, Throwaway since my friends also read Reddit. (Not Sure about this sub specifically).  Sorry for the ridiculous wall of text.\n\nAnyways, Myself and my Fiancee, Ellie, have been seeing each other for about 3 years now.  It's been long distance, and it's been tough with Visa issues and all sorts of other problems to get her into the country.  We finally had the proper statuses granted, and she's finally getting here so we can get hitched ^_^.   Sufficed to say, we're both super relieved that we no longer have to fly halfway around the world every month or 2 to see each other.\n\n\nWe've been planning the wedding, and it's going down in a few months and everyone is super excited since it's a multi-day blow out event (due to my culture), something like 1200 people over 3 days with 350 people at the actual wedding, and 400 people at 2 separate receptions due to the volume of people.  I'll talk more about this a bit later and why the numbers are ridiculous like this and I think some overlap at a pre-wedding shower that happens the day before.\n\n\nAnyways, most of you know long distance is hard, things progress slower, things fall apart faster, so it takes A LOT of work to make them last.   And while I know it's an excuse, I was sort of OK with my friendships weakening because of my love for Ellie.   She ran into a similar problem due to the time commitments involved in the timezone differences and traveling (we'd alternate 1 month me, 1 month her, 1 month both of us got to some destination).  On top of that, I'd usually have to travel for a week or more for work a month.\n\n\nEnter my 2 friends and their wives, Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz (same age as me).    We've been friends since elementary school and while we went to separate colleges, we kept in touch and we all stayed in pretty close contact over the years.   We're not super ultra close friends, but we'd usually hang out once or twice a month and for big events over the past decade...until 3 years ago.  Since my GF at the time lived far away, and I was traveling a lot for work and to see Ellie we all didn't hang out as often.  In all fairness a chunk of it falls on me since I flaked out a few times (though they did a number of times too the few times we were able to plan things).   We ended up only seeing each other once or twice a quarter.  I knew Rachel and Liz for quite some time as well including the full duration of both their relationships with my friends (and we were friends as well).  Steve actually lived with me for about 6 months after he lost his job due to burn out and I let him stay with me until he got back on his feet.  He actually met Rachel during this time and I covered for the fact that he was unemployed and homeless (he's since told her and it's a funny story in our group).\n\n\nMy friends during this time met Ellie maybe once or twice...since our trips weren't long, we'd spend time in each other's company or go do tourist things / meet family, and friends if there was applicable time.  Steve and  Rachel got married 2 years, they threw a smaller wedding about 150 people.  We spoke and they talked about the engagement and everything, but I wasn't really posted on the wedding details.  I found out about the wedding when I had made plans with a friend, Paul, and he was like \"oh dude, we can't that day, it's Steve's wedding...don't you remember?\"   I was a bit dumbfounded and responded with \"oh...I actually didn't know...I wasn't invited.\"\n\n\nCue the next day when Steve calls me and to apologize and say that he got an earful from Paul about me not being invited and not even being invited to the bachelor party and that he'd like to extend and invitation to me to attend the bachelor party but unfortunately that they are at capacity for the wedding and that \"you understand how these things go, we have to cut people all the time. Sorry bro.\"  I tell him thanks for the thought, but that I politely decline, and wish him the best and that I'll catch up with him and Rachel after the wedding.  I was pretty hurt though.  A few weeks later, Ellie was in town, so Steve, Rachel, Ellie and I all went to a really fancy dinner, and I covered it as a simple wedding gift to them (more on this later).\n\n\nA few months later, Andy and Liz get engaged, and I make a joke about hopefully Ellie and I can attend this wedding since we we weren't able to come to the last one (we didn't mention to Andy that Steve didn't invite us).  Lo and behold about 2 months later, Andy calls me and says that \"I tried very hard but we can't get enough people to the wedding, and that it's a relatively small affair (200 people total) and that with family and others, we can't spare space at the ceremony or reception for myself or Ellie. Liz and I want to invite you both out to dinner before and after the wedding.\"   I politely say thank you and that I hope they enjoy the ceremony.  I'm again, pretty hurt but don't want them to feel bad.\n\n\nEnter a few months ago, Ellie and I are traveling in Europe and it just felt right so I put together an impromptu proposal and we got engaged in Paris.   We had talked about it a few times before hand and I was fairly certain she would say yes, and the moment really really just felt right so I proposed with a costume ring I had stealthily bought while we were shopping.  NONE of my friends knew until we announced it on our return...again, I hadn't really planned the proposal, so it wasn't something we announced ahead of time to have a big show about.   We didn't make a big announcement in general, just a number of close friends and family.  \n\n\nAnyways, enter my family.   Ellie and I are of different cultures and ethnicities.  My parents are usually very conservative and I had suspected some blowback from them when I brought an \"outsider\" in.  We were expecting them to want to keep it relatively quiet and small. I, however, was pleasantly surprised that they were super super excited that I was FINALLYYYYYYY getting married and was choosing to settle down.  My mom has had grandchild fever for a few years now...They also absolutely adore and love Ellie.  According to my mom, \"in this day and age, it's hard to find a woman who is both independent and successful in their career, but also able to cook, clean and maintain a household\"...tad sexist I know, but that's how my mom is, I think she's just happy that she has someone she can cook with and share recipes with and all the daughter stuff she's been wanting to do in a house full of 2 boys and a husband.\n\n\nAnyways, my parents offered to help with the wedding...A LOT.   In my culture, it's sort of ridiculous how extravagant the weddings can be.   The guest list is out of control in some respects, but in my culture it's offensive to not invite people to your wedding who have invited you to their wedding.  Additionally, weddings are huge family affairs so this includes folks from years ago and my parents and her parents friends who all get invited, with families in tow.  Ellie and I already planned a much smaller get together with a number of people about a week before the wedding to ensure that we get quality time with our close friends at a mini-reception.  Most of these friends are also invited to the main wedding, everyone understood.  This mini-reception is 50 people and being held on mine and Ellie's dime. We did not invite Steve, Rachel, Andy or Liz to any of the events.  Honestly, I just forgot, maybe a bit bitter...but in all honesty when listing out all the names and families and seating arrangements, our eyes just kind of gloss over.   Our parents both opted to cover 80% of the wedding to accommodate all the cultural norms and to ensure they can invite extended family and friends  We are covering the remaining 20% + honeymoon as well.  While stressful, our parents have been super understanding and helpful in the planning, so Ellie and I are OK with going with the flow.\n\n\nAnyways, Myself and a lot of friends were out last night having a night on the town, including Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz.  Ellie is currently in her home country sorting out her affairs in prep for the final move over to the states.   We're all a bit drunk and Rachel asked when the invites for our wedding were going out.  Without thinking, I blurted out, oh we sent those out months ago.  Another friend chimed in saying \"mannnnnn, I can't even begin to comprehend how insane it is to handle that many people at your wedding, you must be going insane, what's the guest list at...like 1500?\"  Again not paying attention, i was like nooooooo closer to 1200 at which point I saw Rachel's eyes bug out and my sanity kicked in and we all changed the subject.\n\n\nThis morning, Steve lights up my phone with a \"dude, did you seriously not invite us to your wedding?  Rachel is super upset that you didn't invite us, and after you didn't even get us a wedding gift\".  Andy called a few hours later with a \"I thought we were closer than that? You have a HUGE wedding and you couldn't invite us? That hurts...\"  We talked for a few minutes and I mentioned I was out running errands and that I would talk to him later. Same with Steve.\n\n\nHonestly, I don't feel like I'm in the wrong for NOT inviting them.  It sucks, but it is also somewhat offensive that they feel entitled to attend my wedding or claim that I didn't give t hem a wedding gift...when I was not invited, and STILL took them out to expensive and fancy dinner's (100+ a head) to celebrate.\n\n\nI would like to not damage the relationships as much as possible, but at the same time I'm trying to find out how to approach them properly with why I didn't invite them.\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Didn't invite 2 pairs of close friends to my wedding because they did not invite me to theirs.  In my culture not inviting someone to your wedding can be seen as a huge and deeply personal slight.   They claimed capacity issues, in my case, we already have 1200 people coming across multiple events (precisely to avoid this cultural slight).  How do I explain this to them while properly explaining how hurt I was during their weddings?"}, {"comments": ["GIVE HER NOTHING. \n\nYour aunt is an entitled ass. You owe her jack shit.

You didn't ask for this, you didn't do anything to cause this, and you have nothing to be ashamed of. Your mother will probably be pissed or embarrassed, but that's on her for enabling Mr. Creepy. If you can't deal with it, give your bother permission to reach out on your behalf. The purpose is to establish a narrative (so your mom hears from more people how fucked up this is), to get support (emotional, financial, living options), and to take back control (your body, your story, fuck him). He needs your silence to make this work. Rip it from him.\n\n7. That your brother also sees this and can validate how you're feeling is such a huge advantage.

"], "edited": false, "id": "4g8xi7", "body": "Okay, so this is one big overall issue, but its actually 2 different problems that are directly linked:\n\na) This guy acting really creepy towards my sister\n\nb) My mum acting jealous towards my sister, I think, as a result\n\nA bit of background.  My sister was conceived when my parents were still pretty young (18) and they got married as a result.  I always used to tease my sister back when I was a horrible kid about how she was the accident and I was the planned one.  After they got married, they had a son, me.  Alas, their marriage was not meant to last, and while I think they did truly come to love each other and care for each other through the sharing of two kids, they were ultimately two different people who wanted two different things from life.\n\nMy mum wanted to settle down in classic suburbia and have a classic life, my dad was more of an adventurer into travelling across the world and skydiving and what not.  They got divorced while we were quite young, and while it was difficult initially for the pair of us to understand, we never felt unloved and our dad was always there in our life.  He was never neglectful or anything, while our mother was our primary custodian, our dad used to come by quite often and help about.  So while they were divorced, they still had a pretty good relationship, sometimes it was almost like they were dating and I think they did enjoy each others company, but ultimately they were two very different people to be tied down to one another permanently.\n\nAnyhow so my mum's dating this guy (I think he's about the same age as my mum, more or less) that she's actually known for quite some time as an acquaintance.  She knows him from work but they've never been that close and started dating not that long ago, maybe around Christmas last year.\n\nAnyhow she seems quite infatuated with him, but from the start something seemed weird about him.  I don't know if you've ever seen the movie 'American Psycho', but my sister and I love that movie, and we both think this guy is pretty much Patrick Bateman.  Outwardly he's the perfect, chiselled, accomplished business guy; he's charming, polite, almost too charming.\n\nAs a son, I might just be naturally suspicious because he's dating my mum, but he always gave me this serial-killery vibe right from the start.  Not saying he's a serial killer, but let's just say it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if I found out he was.  Something just seems unnatural about him, like almost every thing he does, wears, says, is fake and is perfectly calculated to give off the image he wants of himself.  I suppose that's how you have to be to succeed in the business world, but I never liked him, he never struck me as a genuine person.\n\nAnyhow, my mum seemed to be quite infatuated with him, and she seemed really happy with him from the start.  He expressed affection to her quite often and I think she really appreciated that, it made her feel youthful if I had to guess.\n\nNow to get to the root of the issue:  this guy started doing some seriously creepy stuff towards my sister.  At first we didn't say anything, but only my sister and I noticed.\n\nThe biggest one was one morning when we were all having breakfast at the table, he was there sitting across from me having his cereal, and my sister was bending over to pick up something, and I saw him look like right at her buttcrack, and then he looked at me and smiled and nodded his head towards her like \"eh?\", giving off a super creepy smile.  My mind was thinking like \"what the fuck....\" but I just ignored it cause I didn't want to make a scene or anything.\n\nI told my sister about it as soon as I had the chance, and she agreed he was really creepy.  She told me sometimes she feels him staring at her, especially from behind.  She told me of a bunch of times he made her feel really uncomfortable, like one time she was brushing her hair in the bathroom and he just came up behind her and put his hands on her shoulder and started having a long conversation with her, which included telling her how nice she smelt.  She told me she'd never felt more uncomfortable in her life.\n\nShe said sometimes when she's sitting on the couch watching a movie or tv, he'd come and sit by her and edge closer and put his arm around her, and she'd feel really uncomfortable.  This was in addition to all the times she caught him trying to sneak glances at her.\n\nI also started noticing this, like at the breakfast table, when she was walking past or whatever, he'd start taking quick glances at her from the corner of his eye.\n\nSometimes when my sister and I are up in her bedroom and watching something on her laptop together or listening to music together, he'd come up and be like \"hey kids, what are ya up to?\" and just sit besides her and put his arm around her, and watch whatever we're watching, and like not leave. At all.\n\nSometimes I feel like he acts super extra nice to her, more than to me or my mum.  He's way more touchy with her and tries to sit as close to her as he can, taking glances and peaks here and there.\n\nNeedless to say we both felt very uncomfortable.  My first suggestion is that we have to tell mum about this.  My sister insisted no, she wouldn't understand, she'd get mad at us for suggesting, we can't tell her.  I insisted she has to know that this dude was creeping on her daughter, and eventually my sister relented and she agreed.  We went and told our mum, but she just laughed it off and told us we were being paranoid and ignored the whole thing.  He seems to really have her under his spell.\n\n\nHowever, this is where the second problem began.  We both noticed right after we told her this, and we think she started becoming more aware of the way he was acting, a weird change in our mother's behaviour.  First of all, she started acting almost more \"possessive\" of her boyfriend, almost like she was trying to \"claim\" him.  Not sure what other words to use, but that's what it seemed like to me.  She would suddenly be much more affectionate to him when he was around, like trying to kiss him more often, giving him hugs, being more cuddly with him and smiling around him, calling him more pet names.  Almost like she was trying to 'mark her territory' and show that he was hers and she was his.\n\nIts crazy to think but I think its cause she was starting to feel almost jealous or threatened by her daughter, she was scared of the fact that he might be more interested in her daughter than in her.  I personally think she was becoming more aware of him acting creepy around my sister and taking stares and glances at her, which is what made her more nervous.  She was being more lovey around him, trying to bring him closer to her, they started going to bed 'early' if you know what I mean, and sometimes being disturbingly loud in the bedroom, though not that often, thank heavens.\n\nThe other thing is she started acting jealous towards my sister, and like policing her behaviour and dress.  For example, she started telling my sister off if her pyjamas or nightwear or whatever were too revealing, especially if it was a night that her boyfriend was staying the night at our place.  And she started insisting that my sister wear a bra at home, which really, really annoyed my sister for some reason.  She was like \"no way, I never wear a bra at home\", cause normally she just wears a loose grey jumper or a loose grey shirt when she's at home, that isn't even remotely revealing or anything.  My mum said its inappropriate that she doesn't wear a bra under her clothes, and she was also like \"you're grown up now, you need to wear one\" but my sister said it was uncomfortable to wear one all the time and sleep in one, and she liked to relax when she's at home and not have to worry about that.  But now it seems that our mum was making her worry about that.  She was also policing other things she wore, like ordinary clothes, and told her not wear a towel around the house when she comes out of the shower.  She was like \"wtf why?'  and my mum was like, \"we have two males in this house, your brother and my boyfriend, its inappropriate\" which is weird as fuck given that I'd lived in this house with them all my life and she'd never had a problem with it before.  Also, when like my sister comes and bends over the couch to see what I'm doing, my mum would be like \"dear, stand properly\" or \"sit properly, that's not very lady like\".  Sometimes she'd do it even on nights when her boyfriend wasn't around, but it was mostly when her boyfriend was around which indicated that the boyfriend was the real reason she was acting more policey and insecure.  Sometimes the boyfriend wouldn't even be in the vicinity; like, my sister and I would be upstairs in her bedroom watching something, and my mum would come in and check on us and see what we're doing, then she'd be like \"sweetie, I told you to wear a bra more often\".\n\nNeedless to say, its been annoying the fuck out of my sister.  She's been getting massively annoyed and distressed by the whole thing.  Its bad enough to have this total creep creep on her all the time he's over, but now her own mother is clamping down on her and acting like a jealous insecure teenage girl towards her own daughter.  I can't even begin to imagine how much its bothering her.\n\nShe's talked to me a lot about it, and she's told me how sick she is of all of it and how sick she is of living in this house.  She told me she feels like she's not even safe in her own home any more, she feels like she's being watched constantly, and she hates being alone with this guy.  We tried telling our mother about it already but she brushed it off.\n\nMy sister suggested we go live with our dad instead since we're both adults, but I told her I don't think it would be too conducive to his lifestyle.  He seems to like living on his own and having two teenage brats in the way would hamper that.  I told her nevertheless we should tell him about what's going on, and maybe he can help.\n\nShe immediately insisted no no no, we shouldn't tell him, we shouldn't involve him in this.  I tried to reason and convince her but she was totally against telling dad.  Now this is the part where I feel bad, especially since I might show this post and the replies to her later (sorry sis), but I did tell dad.  I had to. Sorry, really sorry.\n\nI made my dad promise to not let her know that I'd told him, but he gave me advice and told me to watch out for this guy.  He told us to keep our distance and when the time is right, he might have a chat with our mother about it.  He also told me if I ever see him put one inappropriate hand on his daughter in an inappropriate place or anything, or try to make a move on her or anything, that I immediately tell him.  He was like he knows these sort of guys, guys who think they can easily prey on young and naive girls who are still too scared to properly stick up for themselves.\n\nI told my dad about my sister wanting to move in with him, he was like maybe for one of us, but not both, at least not permanently.  I told my sister about that, she was like she didn't want to leave me alone here, she thought if we move out, we should both move out together and she felt safer having me around any way.  I told her I'd be fine on my own, but she was quite insistent.  She suggested maybe looking for a place where we could both move out to and rent together, but I was like, nah, I'm not too interested in that.  I kinda like living at home with mum, its comfy as hell and I have someone to look after me.  She tried insisting, she seemed to think it was the only solution to getting out of this environment, but I said I'd consider it, but honestly I'm not keen on moving out at all. I have nothing against her moving out if she wants to though, but she seems pretty keen that I move out to.\n\nSo yeah, thats the story.  Two main issues:\n\na) Mum's boyfriend is creeping on and acting really weird towards my sister, making her constantly uncomfortable and unsafe when he's around.  We've tried telling our mum, but she brushed it off.  What can we do to stop this creeping and make my sister feel safe?\n\nb) Mum herself started acted strange and jealous towards my sister, policing what she wears and how she acts much more strictly to try to not draw attention to her from her boyfriend.  Its been really annoying my sister and getting on her nerves, how can we get this behaviour to stop?\n\nOne last thing. My sister doesn't use reddit, but she knows of it.  I've considered showing her this post and showing her the replies I get, in case they are of any use to her.  Do you guys think this is a good idea? If so post advice to her as well.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: Mum's boyfriend acting really creepy towards my sister, and as a result mum is acting jealous towards her.

Before we were married, we found out that she could not have kids. At the time this did not concern us. \n\nDuring the early years  of our marriage we decided to foster kids in need and during that time has a girl come into our care at 15 and after a short period, ended up with her full time. Obviously during the initial years we struggled with the normal teenager issues, but grew and accepted her as part of our family and called her our daughter [22F] and called us mum and dad. During the initial 6 years, our family hit some road bumps, but we made it through OK and our daughter had two wonderful children which my wife and I adore. My wife and daughter always had a good relationship and often shared times of coffee, lunch and movies.\n\nRoughly 12 months ago our daughter starting seeing her new boyfriend [29M]. During the initial stages my wife and the daughters boyfriend became close friends due to a number of reasons including the boyfriend needing an understanding person as he had gone through the loss of his own daughter. \n\nThe friendship between my wife and the daughters boyfriend caused a lot of issues to my daughter. My wife and daughters boyfriend starting doing a number of things, including coffee, movies etc. behind my daughters back and without telling the daughter. Further to this the boyfriend would often not tell the daughter what was happening, or only tell her after the fact or tell her that my wife & I liked him more. This caused major issues and I tried to get both the wife and daughters boyfriend to communicate what they were doing and why to the daughters, but this did not resolve any issues. This lead to a range of accusations from the daughter including that both the wife and boyfriend were having an affair, that my wife traded her in for a new friend.\n\nIt initially came to a head last year where the daughter openly said to me that my wife and her boyfriend has sex, even though both strongly denied this. At this time my wife did not want anything to do with our daughter and after a 3-4 weeks period we decided to undertake counselling in an effort to resolve the issue and put them in the past and move forward. After many sessions we all felt better and looked to the future to build a stronger family.\n\nAfter Christmas and boxing day, the allegations started again from the daughter based on alleged comments from my wife to the boyfriend about sex. Both my wife and the daughters boyfriend do not recall discussing sex or even asking the other person for sex. This lead to more accusations from the daughter about lies, affairs etc. etc. This lead to the daughter sending my wife a text message which was pretty bad and including stating our daughter hating my wife, she was having an affair and numerous other allegations. My wife was at wits end and simply replied goodbye and has cut all ties with our daughter.\n\nDuring the past 12 months  I have tried to highlight to my wife that she is playing with the daughters feelings and cannot keep running around behind her back and to open and upfront, I have told the daughter to dump the boyfriend as he has played games with all of us and was destroying the family and told her to stop bring up the past after this being resolved in counselling, and I told the boyfriend what he was doing to our family.\n\nDuring this whole time I have been stuck in the middle and tried to get everyone to understand what was happening. \n\nMy and my wife's relationship was always good, but I have noticed we have drifted apart over recent times and during a break my wife had away and realized my love had dwindled for my wife. \n\nYesterday my wife turned around and said we she wants to get us back on track and stated either I have nothing to do with may daughter or she will leave me.

He\u2019s going to propose to me this summer after I graduate (I went back to college for a second degree), we\u2019re planning our wedding and honeymoon, designing our future house, and we talk about the child we want to have someday. I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say things are serious between us, and we\u2019re deeply in love.\n\nHowever, things have not been so easy for us in the past. Our combined anxiety has caused a lot of grief for us. I\u2019m still struggling with being abandoned and left to fend for myself as a child, and he\u2019s struggling with deep fears from past abuse by his father, brother, and ex-wife, who were all mentally and physically abusive.\n\nUnderstand that George is *so* sweet and loving. He does his best to help me and encourage me any way he can, and it\u2019s clear to me that he wants me to succeed and be happy. But with George it\u2019s like a Jekyll-Hyde thing. Sometimes I can\u2019t even believe my wonderful boyfriend could swap so quickly.\n\nWhen he asked for a pre-nup, I understood: his ex stole everything he owned and left him homeless for months. When he gets nervous and withdrawn in response to my stress, I get it: his dad was abusive whenever something stressful happened. \n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s just my own anxiety, but things are starting to get precarious for me.\n\nAbout once every 2 weeks he asks me if I\u2019m cheating. His ex cheated on him multiple times. Sometimes he just randomly asks, \u201cAre you cheating?\u201d and I\u2019ve been patient because I understand how anxiety can be. I make sure to always show him who I\u2019m texting and snapchatting, and I let him answer my texts when he hears the tone, and see my call logs. Other times it gets more serious. Some months ago he announces that he *knows* I\u2019m cheating, because he found, in the trash, a carryout bag and the remnants of a dinner for two from a restaurant he\u2019d never been to. I point out that it was from the week prior when I\u2019d gone to a caf\u00e9 to meet my sister, and I let the leftovers go bad and just threw them out. But it\u2019s only after I show him an Instagram picture of the meal and a pic of me and my sister from the same place that he believes me.\n\nAnother time, he says he *knows* (he uses that word) I\u2019m cheating because he saw a picture on Meetme of me in my underwear in somebody else\u2019s house. I ask him to show me the picture, and he says it\u2019s already been deleted, and admits it was just from the shoulders-down. I invite him to look at every piece of underwear that I own to see if it looked familiar. He admitted, after searching, that the woman had been wearing a black bra, and he remembered I don\u2019t own one of those because I like white shirts and they always show underneath. After he remembered, he calmed down.\n\nThis last time was the most serious of all. I\u2019ve been stressed due to midterms this past week, and I\u2019ve been nonstop studying in the library. I always study in the same place, by a window in the library, and he\u2019s come along and brought me food and helped me study. When I\u2019m stressed, I can get pretty withdrawn, especially when I\u2019ve got a lot to do. I noticed he was getting more and more nervous about it, which cumulated (I thought) in my accidentally spilling water off my nightstand and swearing up a storm. I said over and over again that it had nothing to do with him, NOTHING was directed at him, he wasn\u2019t even in the room at the time, but he accused me of taking out my stress on him. After that he was extremely withdrawn and moody.\n\nThe next day I was boxing things up to send back home to my parents, and I hear music suddenly blaring from the kitchen and I find George in there cooking dinner, which is something we always do together. I\u2019m in a good mood and I try to join him but he doesn\u2019t let me. He keeps saying that I need to stop being rude to him. I had apologized for every wrong he cited against me, but he maintained that he was just tired of my behavior and, in my mind, it felt like he was deliberately holding on to those past wrongs. This eventually leads to a pretty huge fight, where I shout at him that he\u2019s making my life hell right now on top of all my other stress, and he calls me a cunt and a stupid bitch. I respond by calling him a childish asshole. He runs out the door to go buy cigs down the block, and I leave too, and head back to the library. I stay there until 2AM, studying.\n\nWhen I get home, the first thing I notice is that the front window is shattered. This scares the shit out of me. George has thrown things and broken things before (never at me, never my stuff), so I was afraid of what kind of mood he was in. I go inside and he\u2019s still awake, waiting for me. I don\u2019t say anything to him, it\u2019s very late, I\u2019m tired, and I have an exam in the morning, so I take a shower to help me sleep, I change into my PJs and prepare a bed on the couch, because I don\u2019t want to be near him. As I\u2019m settling in, he walks in and demands to know why \u201cthere\u2019s fresh cum\u201d on my panties. I can\u2019t even believe what I\u2019m hearing. He shows me my panties, and it\u2019s SO ridiculous, because he *knows* I\u2019d been dealing with a yeast infection these past few days, which causes white discharge, and requires white-ish medication. The stuff on my panties is so obviously not cum, but he absolutely believes it is.\n\nSo we fight. I bring up the yeast infection and he seems to realize that I\u2019m right because he immediately abandons that argument and switches to how I\u2019ve been \u201cdisrespecting\u201d him this past week, and he won\u2019t stand for it anymore. I ask how I\u2019ve been disrespecting him. He brings up how I didn\u2019t walk him out of the library the times he\u2019s joined me there. I point out that he always needs to leave before I\u2019m done studying, so I want to stay and keep studying, and I think that\u2019s reasonable. He says I\u2019m ungrateful for his bringing me food and flash-cards in the library. I say that I do remember thanking him, and he finally admits that he\u2019s \u201cgrasping at straws\u201d but that he *does* feel disrespected. I say that it\u2019s his anxiety, and I ask him to please realize that, I try to remind him that we\u2019re best friends and we love each other, and I would never do anything to try and hurt him, but he snidely tells me to go talk to my therapist about it (he doesn\u2019t believe in therapy). He won\u2019t stop yelling until I hide under the covers, plug my ears, and start crying. Then he shouts that I\u2019m \u201cnot a victim\u201d and leaves me alone finally, but my anxiety keeps me up all night, and I end up failing one of my tests the next day because I\u2019m *so* tired and my eyes are so grainy from crying. \n\nBy the next afternoon we\u2019re back on speaking terms. He admits that he knew there wasn\u2019t cum on my panties, because he drove by the library a few times and saw me studying there in the window where I always study. I feel very nervous about this because I realize that even with definitive proof, with his own eyes, that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, he still went ahead and accused me.\n\nRecently we watched *Horns* together, and I mentioned that I thought it was unrealistic how the best friend became a psychopath out of nowhere. I thought, given they\u2019d known him his whole life, there would have been *some* signs that indicated he was crazy, and his friends would\u2019ve had a hunch. George said he wasn\u2019t surprised: he said that he believed *anyone* could snap and become a rapist/murderer out of nowhere, and people could hide their true intentions no matter how well you think you know them. He cited the time his sister-in-law (married to his abusive brother) tried to strangle him out of nowhere.\n\nI know he\u2019s very distrustful of everyone, so I understand why he said that, but still, it made me afraid.\n\nThe last few days have been *so* difficult for me. I already feel very sick to my stomach with nerves. I brought up what he said about *Horns*, and kind of half-jokingly asked if he was going to kill me. He says no but that he does sometimes imagine \u201cpunching me in the face.\u201d I tell him I sometimes think of punching him, too, but I would never actually do that, and he should never do that either because I will leave. He just laughs and says he won\u2019t, and I think the conversation is over, except he suddenly says, \u201cIf you cheated on me, I think I\u2019d be angry enough to try and kill you, and probably succeed.\u201d I respond by saying I would probably be angry enough to kill him if he cheated, but I wouldn\u2019t actually hurt him. He doesn\u2019t really have a response for that.\n\nYesterday he said it again. I mentioned how one of my friends and her now-husband went celibate for their entire engagement period (1-year). He casually responds, \u201cThat sounds horrible. I think if I had to go more than two weeks without sex I\u2019d probably freak out and kill you.\u201d This made my stomach do a flip-flop because it was the second time in two days. I say something like \u201cYou know I won\u2019t be able to have sex for like, 6 weeks after I give birth, right? Even if it\u2019s cesarean, because I need to recover from surgery.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say anything and that freaks me the fuck out, so I press him, \u201cYou *know* that, right?\u201d and he says, \u201cWell it\u2019s gonna be tough.\u201d\n\nThings are spiraling out of control for me. I know I often don\u2019t think straight because of my GAD but I\u2019m not happy with how things are going. I want to tell him not to accuse me of cheating anymore, that I\u2019ve more than proven myself to him, and that we can\u2019t fight like this anymore, and he needs to STOP saying anything about killing me because even if he\u2019s joking it makes me sick to my stomach, but now I\u2019m a little afraid that if I pick a fight about this, he\u2019s going to think that I\u2019m cheating and trying to cover it up somehow. Further, I\u2019m worried that if I can\u2019t account for every minute we\u2019re apart (like cameras following me everywhere) then one day, if my phone dies, or if I get stuck in traffic, or if some male coworker greets me inappropriately against my will, George will believe I\u2019m cheating and possibly kill me?\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** Boyfriend saying some worrying stuff including casually mentioning killing me and now I\u2019m flipping out, but I have issues too so I don't know if it's him or me.

We didn't even set a date until late 2014 when we both realized I'd like to marry this person, not because our parents set us up but because we actually were in love and wanted to be together.\n\n\nWe both had our bachelor/bachelorette parties this weekend and it wasn't anything really, my girlfriends and I went to dinner, had some wine and that was it. My brother informed me Sunday night that my fiance had sex with a girl they picked up at a bar they were drinking at. Apparently his (fiance, not my brother) best friend, who is married himself, invited the girl there as my fiance's best friend worked with the girl and knew my fiance thought she was cute the few times they met.\n\n\nIt wasn't a big bachelor party, only 8 guys or so and apparently the girl who came to meet them at the bar. By the time my fiance left with the girl, it was only his best friend, my brother and one other single friend of ours who was with a girl he met that night.

He said he feels as though it was not natural and that over the past year due to cold feet, he's been falling out of love with me.

You make peace within yourself with what someone else did to you, find a way to go on with your life.

Two years later- we found out there was going to be a baby. We were both terrified.\n\nShe was still in high school and I was working a few crappy jobs and not done with my tech degree. We'd had a whole life planned out and this hadn't been in it? You know?\n\nBut within a few days of her telling me, I had calmed down and I knew we could do this. The first year would be tough, but then I would graduate and have a good job and we could make it work. We planned our new life out together- when she'd go to school, how'd we make it all work, and then we talked of names. We liked Luke for a boy. I still remember that night in a parking lot, when we mapped out our life on a napkin and fell in love with the baby.\n\nHer parents flipped out though. I still remember telling them, in my job interview clothes and holding her hand. They had been teen parents and I kind of thought they'd take it better. They flipped out. Her dad yelled horrible, horrible nonredeemable stuff. Her mom nodded along. They said they hadn't raised her to ruin her life.\n\nI took her from there because christ my dad was a pos but he never talked to me that way. I couldn't let her dad, God she worshipped her dad, talk to her that way. And I tried to make her feel ok, but god that wrecked her. It really did. I dropped her off later that night and she smiled a little when we talked about the baby, and that was the last time she would.\n\nHer dad told her flat out that if she didn't give the baby up for adoption he would not be able to look at her or respect her. He went on and on and on- he told her the kid would never forgive her. That once the baby came I wouldn't finish school and she'd never gone and the kid would grow up in a crappy apartment with a dad who delivered pizza and hated his mom. All lies...and spewed with this deep hatred.\n\nSo she told me we couldn't keep him, that if we did we wouldn't last- it'd break us up and he'd hate us. She told me that'd we be strong for him and then we'd be strong for each other. And we gave him up. To a really wonderful couple. And maybe it was best for him, but god I gave away my kid and I don't think that will ever go away.\n\nAfterwards, we were like zombies she used to touch my face and say \"He had your nose\" or \"I think his chin would have been like yours\". I remembered the weight of him when I held him and that life we planned out with him. Finally one day no long after she couldn't look at our face anymore. We broke up. Which made everything worse for me. It made it worse for her too. She just stopped...everything.\n\nI could forgive her parents, I think, if that were all. But then her teen brother's girlfriend got pregnant and suddenly they were accepting grandparents. You can imagine what a betrayal that felt like for us. In the end, she couldn't live in that house with a baby and it brought us together, again. This time we mourned together.\n\nWe got married two years ago and I did finish my tech degree. She graduates in May with her LPN. We are happy, really we are. But there is a shadow of what might have been that will never stop. And now we are having a baby, a planned baby. She's only three months along but we are really excited. I hope it's a little girl.\n\nWe've only seen her parents a handful of times since then. Each time brief, but I can't forgive them and I don't see how I can. I didn't type out all the horrible things her dad said, before the baby, after, and when she moved in with me.\n\nHowever, now that we're having a baby they seem to think we can all be great. My wife would like for this to happen, I think, but is struggling with it. I can't help but feel like that bastard thinks a baby=a baby. Even though, this will and will always be our second child. It's not a replacement.  I am adamant that they cannot come to the hospital due to their actions/words the last time. I want this to be a happy time. Her dad is a miserable bastard.\n\nAm I crazy for not forgiving them? \n\ntl;dr I(24m) cannot pretend my inlaws didn't horribly wrong my wife(22f) and I in an irreparable way, due to their actions and pressure to give up our first child for adoption. He in particular said horrible, horrible things. Now we are married expecting a child and they seem to think everything is gravy. I don't want a closer relationship with them- at all- and esp don't want them to come see us at the hospital. Am I wrong to feel this way? Should I move on and forgive?"}]}
